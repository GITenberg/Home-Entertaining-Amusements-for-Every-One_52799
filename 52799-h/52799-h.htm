<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> collection of games, tricks, and pastimes
is the result of many years’ effort to find
the most clever and practical diversions and
entertainments suitable for the home. Each
trick has been tested by the editor, and each
sport introduced has received most careful
consideration in regard to ease of production,
as well as the enjoyment to be gained from it.</p>

<p>As no refined person of any age can find
amusement in coarseness, great care has been
exercised in presenting only such diversions
as are to be welcomed in a refined home circle.
The necessity for elaborate apparatus has also
been avoided, so that with dullness, difficulty,
expense, and ill-taste eliminated, it is felt that
this collection will supply a lack which has
always existed, as the many who have sought
in vain for a bright, safe, and up-to-date book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
of really feasible entertainments will appreciate.</p>

<p>While this book contains much that is original,
especially in descriptive matter and ways
of presentation, it has of course been necessary
to draw freely from the accumulated mass of
tricks and “sells” that have in some form or
other come down from unknown times, and are
recognized as being the common property of
any who take pains to learn them. As a matter
of courtesy, due acknowledgement is hereby
made to all who have preceded me in this line
of work.</p>

<p>A word of general advice to the amateur
entertainer may be in order. Never tell the
company what you are about to do, unless the
very nature of a trick demands that its outcome
be stated in advance. In this case, do it as
guardedly as possible. If you state that you
are to perform a certain trick, you thereby
greatly increase the chance of detection, as
the spectators will know what to look for, and
in that way will more readily arrive at the true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
method of bringing about the results. Do not
allow yourself to be persuaded into performing
a trick twice in an evening. With the element
of surprise gone, the best performance loses
much of its effect. Finally, remember that a
great deal depends upon the personality of the
entertainer. An easy flow of pleasantries, which
may or may not have to do with what is being
performed, adds to the entertainment of the
company, and at the same time helps much in
diverting the attention of your friends from
too close a scrutiny of your proceedings.</p>

<h2>What To Do and How To Do It</h2>


<p class="section"><b>The Magnetic Ring.</b> Take a gold ring,—the
more massive the better. Attach the ring
to a silk thread about twelve inches long; fasten
the other end of the thread around the nail-joint
of your right forefinger, and let the ring
hang about half an inch above the surface of
the table, on which you rest your elbow to
steady your hand. Hold your finger horizontally,
with the thumb thrown back as far as
possible from the rest of the hand.</p>

<p>If there be nothing on the table, the ring will
soon become stationary. Then place some
silver (say three half-dollars) immediately below
it, when the ring will begin to oscillate
backwards and forwards, to you and from you.
Now bring your thumb in contact with your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
forefinger (or else suspend the ring from your
thumb), and the oscillations will become transverse
to their former swing. Or this may be
effected by making a lady take hold of your
disengaged hand. When the transverse motion
is fairly established, let a gentleman take hold
of the lady’s disengaged hand, and the ring
will change back to its former course. These
effects are produced by the aid of animal magnetic
currents given forth by the hands of the
experimenters.</p>


<p class="section"><b>To Tell the Hour of the Day or Night by a Suspended
Quarter.</b> Sling a quarter or a dime at
the end of a piece of thread by means of a loop;
then, resting your elbow upon a table, hold the
other end of the thread between your forefinger
and thumb, and thus suspend the coin
in an empty goblet. Observe, your hand must
be perfectly steady; and if you find it difficult
to keep it in an immovable posture, it is useless
to attempt the experiment. Premising that the
quarter is properly suspended, you will find that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
when it has recovered its equilibrium, it will
for a moment be stationary; it will then, of its
own accord and without the least agency from
the person holding it, assume the action of a
pendulum, vibrating from side to side of the
glass, and after a few seconds will strike the
hour nearest to the time of day. It is necessary
to observe that the thread should lie over the
pulse of the thumb, and this may in some measure
account for the vibration of the quarter,
but to what cause its striking the precise hour
is to be traced remains unexplained; for it is no
less astonishing than true that when it has
struck the proper number its vibration ceases,
it acquires a kind of rotary motion and finally
becomes stationary as before.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Spirit Calculator.</b> A piece of paper and
a pencil are handed to the audience, with a
request that four different persons will each
write down a row of four figures, one under
the other, to form an addition sum. The paper
is then given to a fifth person to add up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
figures, but before he can call out the result
the performer writes it down on a blackboard.</p>

<p>The secret lies in the fact that the performer
is in possession of a piece of paper exactly the
same in every detail as that handed to the
audience, on which, previous to the entertainment,
he has had four rows of figures written
in different handwritings. In the course
of the entertainment, all is fair and aboveboard
until it comes to adding up the sum,
when the performer, in the act of giving the
paper to the fifth person, changes it for that
of his own, with the total of which he is already
acquainted. He has now only to run to the
stage and write down the answer on the blackboard.</p>

<p>A more startling conclusion than the prosaic
one above mentioned may be obtained by
the use of sympathetic ink, composed of sulphuric
acid and water, one part of the former
to three of the latter. Writing done with this
ink will be invisible until heat be applied, which
will bring out the characters in jet black.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>The performer, then, being provided with a
piece of paper bearing the answer written with
the invisible ink, gives a plate containing a
little alcohol to the person adding up the sum,
and asks him to set fire to the alcohol, first,
however, taking careful note of the total. The
prepared piece of paper is now held over the
flames caused by igniting the alcohol on the
plate, when the heat will bring out the answer,
which is proved to be correct. The greatest
care should always be exercised in producing
any kind of flame.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Square of Sixteen Numbers.</b> Arrange
the numbers from 1 to 16 in a square, so that
the sum of the figures in any row, vertical, horizontal,
or diagonal, will be 34.</p>

<p class="section"><b>Making a Bird Enter a Cage.</b> Draw upon a
sheet of paper an empty bird-cage and then
very near the cage at the right draw a bird.
The problem is to make this bird enter the cage.</p>

<p>Place a visiting-card between the two figures,
holding the card perpendicularly on the paper.
Press the end of your nose on the border of the
card and look at the cage and the bird. You
will thus see the cage with your left eye and the
bird with your right. But in a moment the
bird will seem to move, then enter the cage.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Handkerchief Snake.</b> A fine black-silk
thread is stretched across the stage from one
side to the other, the ends being in the hands of
two assistants. Having obtained the loan of
a handkerchief, the performer, standing behind
the thread, takes it diagonally by two corners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and twists it up rope fashion. He then ties
three knots in it, one a little below the centre,
one a little above the centre, and the third at
one end. While this is being done, the assistants
raise the thread, around which the last
knot, forming the head of a snake, is actually
tied; but owing to the thread being invisible,
this will pass unobserved.</p>

<p>Having made the last knot, the performer
drops the handkerchief on the floor, when its
imitation of a live snake will depend entirely
on the adroit manner in which the assistants
manipulate the thread.</p>

<p>Finally, it should be made to jump into the
hand of the performer, who should at once
hand it with the knots still tied to the owner.
This is managed by the assistant at one end
dropping the thread and the other one pulling
it clear of the handkerchief. Other tricks may
be invented.</p>


<p class="section"><b>To Pass your Body through a Postal Card.</b>
Fold the card once lengthwise in the middle so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that there will be two equal flaps. Now commence
at the folded edge and cut almost to the
straight edge, double thickness, then commence
at the straight edge and cut almost to the folded
edge, and so on alternately, until there have
been about twenty-five or thirty cuts made,
leaving a very small margin between each cut.
Then cut each loop on the folded edge except
the two outside loops, and open.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Silhouettes.</b> Choose a part of the room where
there is a clear wall space. Attach a piece of
silhouette paper to the wall with thumb tacks
or pins (or against a broad board if you fear
that the tacks may injure the wall), the white
side of the paper being out.</p>

<p>A lamp, or better a candle, having been
placed so that it will throw a strong light on
the sheet of paper, turn off all the other lights
in the room. Each one then takes his place
between the lamp and the wall so that a clear
shadow of his profile may be thrown on the
paper. Now draw a firm, strong line carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
around this shadow. The sitter must sit perfectly
still, during the drawing. If possible
have a head-rest, the shadow of which must
not be seen upon the paper. Having thus outlined
the shadow, take the paper from the wall
and cut out the silhouette neatly or pass it to
another to do the same.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Gymnastics for the Tongue.</b> Say these several
times as rapidly and distinctly as you can:
“She sells sea shells at the sea shore,” and these
also: “John sawed six sleek, slim, slender saplings.”
“There was an old woman and she was
a thistle sifter. She had a sieve of sifted thistles,
and a sieve of unsifted thistles, and she was a
thistle sifter.” “Mixed biscuits.” “Gig whip.”
“Six thick thistle sticks.” “She stood at the
door welcoming him in.” “Shoes and socks
shock Susan.”</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Passenger to Boulogne.</b> The requirements
for this touching picture are an orange,
a pocket-handkerchief or soft table-napkin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
and a wine-glass. The orange is first prepared
by cutting in the rind with a pen-knife the best
ears, nose, and mouth which the skill of the
artist can compass, a couple of raisins supplying
the place of eyes. A pocket-handkerchief
is stretched lightly over the glass, and the
prepared orange laid thereon.</p>

<p>The pocket-handkerchief is then moved
gently backwards and forwards over the top of
the glass, imparting to the orange a rolling motion,
and affording a laughable but striking
caricature of the agonies of a sea-sick Channel
passenger.</p>

<p>The performance terminates by draping the
pocket-handkerchief hood-fashion over the supposed
head, and squeezing the orange into the
glass. The last scene, however, is disagreeably
realistic.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Mind-Reading.</b> Before appearing to the
audience, fasten a fine black thread to the thumb
(or any part desired). The other end is retained
by an assistant seated back to the audience,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and in back from the performer, so that the
thread will not be noticed. While the performer
is promising a mind-reading exhibition,
the assistant will have time to make the thread
tight, and it must be kept so during the performance.
Show a small blackboard, or some other
similar arrangement, that can be held in one
arm, and ask any one to secretly suggest figures,
which are put down in columns, for the purpose
of addition. The figures must be large enough
for every one to see, and it is advisable not to
have too many, as experience will show it takes
too long for the trick. The performer then mentally
adds the right column of figures, after
which he secretly pulls the thread, fastened to
the thumb, as many times as necessary to make
the correct number. The assistant counts the
little jerks, and then announces the number,
which proves to be the correct number to set
down. This is continued until all the figures
are added. If the sum of a column is a “zero”
no pull should be made. The details must be
plainly understood between the performer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
assistant, and with a little ingenuity the trick
will seem quite puzzling.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Blowing a Card on Twine.</b> Procure some of
the nicest twine, that is hard, smooth, and very
slippery, and cut into lengths of fifteen or
twenty feet, according to room available, fastening
both ends to something stationary. The
number of these lines may be optional, but not
less than two. On each line, near the end,
place a card four inches square, with a hole
exactly in the centre, about three times the
diameter of the twine. Care must be taken
that the hole is large enough to allow the card
to move properly but not too freely. At a
given signal the card is blown the length of the
line. The one arriving at the end first, wins.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Naming a Card.</b> This trick can be shown at
any time and at any place where two performers
are together and desire to show a little skill
to amuse their friends. The idea in the trick is
to announce that you can tell the name of a
card written on a sheet of paper, the paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
folded and placed on the table, all being done
while you are out of the room. After you have
announced the trick and have left the room,
your assistant (who of course acts as if he were
disinterested) takes a pencil, and when some one
names the card he writes it on the paper and
folds it up. For example, we will say that the
four of diamonds was named. When he has
finished writing the name of the card, he, in an
offhand way, places the pencil on the table, so
that the point would indicate four in an imaginary
clock, he of course sitting opposite to
six. The paper is then folded and placed in a
casual way on the opposite side on the table,
in a section which we will designate as diamonds.
These sections may be like this: diamonds
at the top of the imaginary clock, hearts at the
right, clubs at the bottom, and spades at the
left. The face of the clock can be imagined
to be about a foot or so round. You may now
be called in by anybody, and upon entering, you
must, to make the trick effective, take up the
paper, and hold it to your forehead as if in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
deep thought. Of course you have taken in
at a glance the entire situation, and in a most
mysterious way, name the card. In case a court
card is named you will understand that a jack
is eleven, a queen twelve, and if a king is named,
the pencil is not laid down, the paper only being
left to indicate the suit. Now some are bound
to name the joker. In that case your assistant
simply places the paper on top of the pencil or
uses some other arrangement agreed upon.</p>


<p class="section"><b>A Horse Race.</b> Each man in the party
receives a little bag containing one hundred
beans. Each woman adopts the name of some
horse. Strips of tape or paper are fastened at
one end of the room farthest away from where
the races are to begin. All attached ends are
on the same line. The loose ends are held by
the women on the other side of the room, armed
with scissors. The men bet their beans on the
outcome of the race. At a given signal, each
woman begins to cut the tape, the one to reach
the end of her strand quickest being the winner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
The narrowness of the tape obliges the

the rollers. The crank is turned and the
record announced amidst a grating noise peculiar
to phonographs. A person behind the
scenes, with his head in the box, drawls out the
subjects of the records, making the scraping
noise by rubbing something rough against a tin

only one extremity of the lower match, it
seems clear that the fourteen matches on top
will fall to the table by the force of gravity.
Here is a way to render the operation feasible.
Above the matches and along the angle formed
by the interlacement, place one last match.
They can now be lifted safely by the extremity
of the under match. The matches will take
an oblique position, embracing the upper one
within their angle as though they were possessed

support just as long as you wish. By preference,
employ the largest matches you can

<p class="section"><b>The Dwarf Exhibit</b> affords one of the most
amusing entertainments, and will cause wonder
to your friends as to where you got “him.”</p>

<p>Two persons play the dwarf, a third acting
as the exhibitor, who should prepare beforehand
a humorous speech, setting forth the history
and accomplishments of the dwarf, which
will be told later.</p>

<p>To arrange and dress the dwarf, place a table
in a doorway between two rooms, and cover
it with a cloth or a curtain that will reach to
the floor on the side farthest from the audience.
Or the table may be placed entirely in the room
next to that in which the audience is seated,
the edge of it reaching to the doorway, so that
the curtains between may act as a screen while
you are getting the dwarf ready.</p>

<p>One person stands behind the table and places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
his hands on it. These, with his arms, form
the feet and legs of the dwarf. Over his arms
should be drawn a pair of boy’s trousers, and
on his hands should be a pair of shoes. The
trousers should be drawn down until they reach
the heels, like a man’s. This completes the
lower part of the dwarf.</p>

<p>The second person stands behind the first
and passes his arms around his shoulders. By
putting a coat over the arms and buttoning it
down the figure of the first impersonator and
then throwing a cape around his neck so arranged
as to cover the head of the person behind,
you will complete the dwarf’s dress.</p>

<p>Of course, you may have to improvise a
jacket to fit, or you may dress the dwarf fantastically,
as a Turk, or woman, for instance, but
the means of doing so will suggest themselves
readily.</p>

<p>The hands of the second person act as the
hands of the dwarf, and as the latter makes his
appearance they raise his hat when he bows to
the audience. The exhibitor then begins his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
history, which can be made very ludicrous; and
he should recite the various accomplishments
of the dwarf, including dancing, and even his
ability to suspend himself in the air without
support.</p>

<p>The dwarf should then be invited to entertain
the audience, and he should begin by making
a little speech, in either a thin falsetto or
a heavy bass voice, assumed, of course, to add
to the grotesque effect. The second player
makes gestures to the speech, which in themselves
will create a laugh.</p>

<p>Then the dwarf should begin to dance. The
hands of the first performer do this, and all of
a sudden, in the middle of a quickstep, they
both are lifted from the table and remain suspended
in the air for a quarter of a minute.
Then they drop to the table again, and the
dwarf appears to be exhausted with this unusual
effort.</p>

<p>In making his parting salute to the audience
the dwarf astonishes them all by putting both feet
to his mouth and throwing kisses with his toes.</p>

etc., can be made by sticking the toothpicks
into the peas.</p>


<p class="section"><b>An Introduction to the Doll Family.</b> If you
straighten a hairpin, then bend one end of it
until it resembles a shepherd’s crook, and hang
it on the edge of a table, it will swing back and
forth many times like the pendulum of a clock.
The slightest touch sets it in motion, and if you
have just the right angle to the crook it will
sway back and forth many times.</p>

<p>Suppose you fix several hairpins in this fashion
and set them all to swinging at once. It will
much resemble a lot of very slender gentlemen
bobbing up and down in stately, graceful bows.
Very well; suppose we have some real gentlemen
to bow to us. Get two or three old magazines
and look through the advertising sections.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
You will find lots and lots of figures of all kinds,
men, women, and animals; some of them just
the size you want. Cut out some of these very
carefully, selecting those just a little longer
than your bent hairpins.</p>

<p>Now thrust a hairpin through one of the
figures and hang the bent end of the hairpin
on the edge of a table; or, better still, a big
book whose cover overlaps the leaves inside.
Blow gently at the figure and it will answer by
bowing most politely, bobbing back and forth
in the funniest way you can imagine. Now fix
the rest of the figures in the same way and you
will have one of the most amusing collections of
dolls that ever was. Whenever you blow at
them, they all will nod and bow at once, but
no two will move alike, for the shapes of their
figures will all be different, and the different
ways in which their weight or centre of gravity
inclines them will cause the various motions.</p>

<p>Just try it with some of your little friends
and see what fun these odd little actors will
make for you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>


<p class="section"><b>Second Sight.</b> This cannot fail to make a

<p class="section"><b>Novel Paper-Cutting.</b> A long strip of paper
is shown to the audience; it is then rolled up
into cylindrical form, a few cuts are made with
a scissors, or if the paper is not too thick, it
may be torn with the fingers. You make a
twist or two, and the audience are surprised
to see what a good resemblance to a “fir tree,”
five or more feet in length, makes its appearance
in the performer’s hands. This is managed in
the following way: Cut a strip of paper about
nine feet long and eight inches wide; to increase
the effect, the strip of paper can be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
up of three or four short lengths of different
colored papers pasted together. Roll the paper
up into a cylinder of about 1¼ inches in diameter,
then with a pair of scissors make cuts
through the cylinder from one end, to halfway
down its length. These cuts should be at
small, equal distances from each other around
the roll. Then bend over into horizontal
position each piece of loose paper to form
the branches of the tree, pull out from the
centre of the top in the same way as for the
familiar barber’s pole; the tree will then be
complete.</p>

<p>To thoroughly grasp the idea, the instruction
should be carefully followed with scissors and
paper in hand.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Mysterious Remainder.</b> A mother of

<p>“Double it.”</p>

<p>The child thought, but did not say eight.</p>

<p>Perhaps she would say, “Add six to it.”</p>

<p>“Divide it by two.”</p>

<p>“Take away the first number you thought of
and the remainder will be three.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, four from seven does leave
three; the children were much puzzled to know
how mother knew. The next thing was always
a request to try it again.</p>

<p>Suppose 1000 was chosen.</p>

<p>“Double it,” was the order.</p>

<p>“Add ten to it,” was the next command.</p>

be right at home, and at the end of the five
minutes had a list of thirty expressions. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the prize unexpectedly went to a little lady
who could think of only one word of slang. In
presenting it, the hostess said, “You have used
the best English, and the best slang.”</p>

<p>The lawyer, whose list of slang was the longest,
received a booby prize. The point, of
course, is that the least slang is the best.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Observation Contest.</b> Have on tables and
pinned on curtains, etc., quantities of small
objects. Provide pads for all and let each have
three minutes to observe each table, each part
of the room, etc., and then five minutes to note
down in another room all that she remembers to
have seen. This is great fun. The prize should
be given to the one with the keenest power
of observation.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Bargain-Counter Game.</b> The Christmas
bargain-counter is a charming fireside
game for Christmas night that will amuse and
at the same time instruct the nursery children.
The bargain-counter may be the nursery table
set in front of the fireplace or hearth. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
counter are laid as many as one likes of the toys
which the children received from tree and
Christmas stockings. One child is chosen to
take charge of this play toy shop, and a second
child leaves the room after looking carefully
first at all the toys on the counter to determine
their names. While this child is absent
from the room a third child selects and hides
one of the toys. When the second child returns
he must try at one guess to say which of the
toys was sold during his absence. If he guesses
successfully he may be the next toyman. To
make the game more difficult two or more toys
may be hidden. Another and slightly more
difficult way of playing the bargain-counter
game is to have the toyman change the positions
of the toys while the child is out of the
room. The child on returning must rearrange
them, if he can, in exactly the same positions.
They may be scraps of color instead of toys.
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet
ribbons, balls or Christmas tree candles may
be laid out in the order of the rainbow colors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
While one child is either blindfolded or outside
the room, the child in charge of the colors removes
one from sight or alters the color order,
and the other child must guess the hidden color
or restore the rainbow order on his return.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The “Thirty-five” Trick.</b> An envelope,
handed to any person in the company at the
outset, contains a slip of paper, bearing the
number 35. This is kept in the person’s pocket
until the close of the trick; or the number 35
can be written on the inside of a trick slate,
or elsewhere, for production in due course.</p>

<p>The performer now goes around with a slip
of paper, which he hands to some one, with a
request to place any single figure thereon. This
done, he gives the paper to a second person to
place another figure under the first, and so on
to as many persons in succession as necessary.
As each figure is written, he secretly adds all together
until the total reaches 26 or over; when
this is the case, he stops calling for more figures
and, retaining the paper, remarks, “That will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
do, thank you, but I would like to place this
gentleman’s initials on the paper for the purpose
of identification.” The initials are given and
written on the paper by the performer, who at
the same time takes the opportunity thus afforded
of placing another figure, to make the
sum total 35, at the foot of those already
written. This done, the paper may be handed
to any person to add up the sum, for the simple
reason that the trick cannot now fail. Of course
no one ever thinks of checking the number of
figures on the paper with the number of persons
who wrote them. The envelope containing the
slip of paper is now opened, and the two
amounts compared.</p>


<p class="section"><b>An Ink Shock.</b> Cut a piece of black paper to
imitate spilled ink. Lay it flat on a white table
cover. Beside it, place an upset dry ink bottle.
This will shock the mistress of the house.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Reading from Folded Papers.</b> For this trick,
you enlist the service of a friend. Each one
is given a slip of paper and told to write on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
it a question. Fold up well and drop into
a hat. Mix them up, and, holding the hat over
your head, pick out any paper, and without
unfolding it, answer the question, doing the
same with the rest.</p>

<p>In order to do this, you must know your
friend’s question, and as you collect the papers,
slip it under the band inside the hat. When
performing, take any slip, but answer your
friend’s question first. Now open, to prove
yourself right, and thereby see another question.
This is answered while the next is held, and so
on until the last, when all and the one in the
hat are mixed and left for the audience for investigation.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Blind Man’s Buff with Dominoes.</b> Sit opposite
another player, each placing his right
foot on the other’s left. Turn the dominoes
face down and the game now begins. Of course
each one must look at his domino before he
plays it, but he does not show it to the other.
The pressure of your foot on his shows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
number with which you begin, without the possibility
of a blunder, although playing the dominoes
face downward. He now counts the
movements of your foot, which indicate the number
he is to match. He then presses your foot
with the number you are to match. This is
continued until all the dominoes are played.
When the game is finished, turn the dominoes
over to show that the numbers have been played
with perfect exactness.</p>

<p class="section"><b>“My Aunt Has Arrived from Paris.”</b> A
circle is formed, all kneeling on the floor. The
leader says to the one on his right side, “My
aunt has arrived from Paris,” and the one addressed,
asks the question, “What did she
bring you?” The leader answers, “A
pair of scissors,” and at once imitates
the opening and shutting of the scissors
with two fingers. This same question is
asked, answered, and imitated by each one
around the circle.</p>

<p>The leader again says, “My aunt has arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
from Paris,” and the one addressed asks,
“What did she bring you?” The leader, still
keeping up the scissors motion, says, “A fan,”
and at once imitates fanning with the other
hand. This goes around the circle as before.</p>

<p>The leader then announces in the same way,
“A Japanese doll,” and imitates by bowing his
head backward and forward, which goes around
the circle. Then a rocking-horse is announced
by the leader, and is imitated by moving the
body up and down, all the while remaining on
the knees. This also goes around the circle.</p>

<p>Finally in the same manner the leader announces
a cuckoo, and immediately gives the
imitation of a cuckoo, which is also done in turn
around the circle. All five imitations are to be
kept up continuously by each one until the
players are exhausted. The one holding out
the longest is the winner.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Surprising Strength.</b> Just lightly put the
tips of your fingers together. If you invite any
one to separate them by taking your wrists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and trying to draw them apart in a direct line
with each other, they will be surprised to find
that no amount of strength will avail them at
all, as the thing is really almost impossible.</p>

<p>Place your clenched fists one upon the other,
and ask some one to separate them by pushing
them aside. They will be quite unable to do
so, although you are exerting your strength but
little against them.</p>

<p>Let them, however, approach you with the
forefingers only, and give a sharp rap at your
knuckles in opposite directions. You will find
in this case that you are quite powerless against
this, and cannot keep your fists together at all.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Card-passing Contest.</b> Divide the players
equally and seat them in two rows facing each
other. The leader of each row is provided with
a pack of playing cards. At a given signal, each
leader passes one card to the next person, who
in his turn gives it to the next person, and so
on down the line until the last one drops it
on the floor beside him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>The side that gets the last card on the floor
first wins the game. The cards may be passed
to the right on each side, moving in opposite
directions.</p>


<p class="section"><b>A Cobweb Tangle.</b> Have as many balls of
twine as there are players. Starting at a given
point, fasten each end securely. Starting from
this point, wind the twine in every conceivable
place, wherever you care to have the players
go; under tables, around chairs, door-knobs,
upstairs, and anywhere that can be made difficult
without doing any injury to the surroundings.
When the winding is completed, fasten
the string to a small round stick about three or
four inches long. All this should be done before
the guests arrive, as it takes some time to do
it. When ready for the game, have the guests
draw the sticks and then proceed to wind the
twine until they arrive at the end. The one
arriving there first wins a prize.</p>

a printed card asking him to call at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
house of a lady who is to be his partner for the
evening. The ladies change places with one
another, so that when the gentlemen call for
them, they will not be in their home but in the
home of one of the other ladies. As the ladies
are masked and do not have to talk, the gentlemen
never find out their mistake until all
are unmasked.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Hit the Bag.</b> A bag about the size of a person’s
head, or larger if desired, made of tissue
paper, or other very thin paper, containing
candy, is suspended from the ceiling by a string
so that it will be about six feet from the floor.
A person is blindfolded and a cane, or a stick
about the length of a cane, is placed in the person’s
two hands, allowing the farther end to
touch the bag. The performer is then requested
to take three steps backward and then turn
around three times, alone. When this is done,
he is requested to take three steps forward,
strike three times and break the bag. The
cane can have only a perpendicular motion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Each one tries the same, until the bag is
broken, when all present scramble to see who
will gather the most candy.</p>


<p class="section"><b>A Pretended Illusion.</b> Place three coins on
a table, coins 1 and 2 being only a short distance
from each other, while the coins 2 and 3
are more than double the distance apart. Now
point out to a spectator that a curious optical
illusion can be observed by placing one eye
on the level of the table edge and looking along
the line of the coins. The spectator having
done so, ask him which two coins he considers
are the farthest away from each other and to
point them out. He will probably point out
coins two and three. You immediately point
to the coins 1 and 3, and say you consider these
coins are the farthest away from each other.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Dancing Fairies.</b> Most of you have seen the
smooth, round beans called “magic beans.”
They were brought to this country several
years ago from the East Indies, and were a
great curiosity until their secret was discovered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>First get a half-dozen or more of the dancing
or “magic” beans. These are now sold in
most of the large Japanese stores.</p>

<p>Cut out a half-dozen of tiny paper dolls.
They must be made so that they are light, and
so that their feet can be pasted securely to both
sides of the bean. Cut out skirts of tissue paper
which will cover the dolls’ legs and hide the
beans without touching them. When these
are made so that they will balance well, place
them upon a heated plate and soon every little
fairy will begin to dance in a mysterious way.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Describing a Lady’s Costume.</b> When the
guests arrive, have them all meet in one room.
Every gentleman is presented with a card on
which is written the name of some lady present,
and the hostess announces that each gentleman
must talk five minutes to the lady whose name
his card bears. The reason for the conversation
is not divulged. At the end of the appointed
time, the ladies withdraw, and then the men are
told to each write out a description of the dress<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the lady wore, the color of her eyes, of her hair,
the fashion of wearing it, etc., etc. The ladies

<p class="section"><b>The Wonderful Hat.</b> Upon a table place
three pieces of bread, or any other eatable, at
a little distance from each other, and cover
each with a hat. Take up the first hat, and,
removing the bread, put it into your mouth,
letting the company see that you swallow it.
Then raise a second hat and eat the bread which
is under that, then proceed to the third hat
in the same manner. Having eaten the three
pieces, ask any person in the company to choose
which hat he would like the three pieces of
bread to be under, and when he has made his
choice of one of the hats, put it on your
head and ask him if he does not think
they are under it.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Mirror-Drawing.</b> To carry out this test you
will need a sheet of paper, a mirror about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
width of the paper, a pencil, and another sheet
of paper or a large card or book.</p>

<p>Lay the paper flat on the table. Then prop
up the mirror opposite you and the paper so
that it is at right angles with the paper and
reflects it. You may stand the mirror against
a pile of books if it has no standard of its own.
After you have done this, take the extra sheet
of paper in your left hand and hold it so that
it is between your eyes and the piece of paper
which is lying on the table. You must hold
the piece of paper in your left hand so that
you cannot see the paper lying on the table,
except in the mirror.</p>

<p>You are now ready to begin drawing, first
announcing what you intend to draw. It
should be some simple object, represented by
some few straight lines, such as a kite, a box,
or a square, with a straight line going from each
corner diagonally across. You draw with
your right hand, holding the paper with your
left, so that you cannot see what progress you
are making except in the mirror. Watch the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
mirror all the time until the drawing is completed.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Dancing Skeleton.</b> Get a piece of
board about the size of a large school slate and
have it painted black. The paint should be
what is known as a dead color, without gloss or
brightness. (A large school slate would answer
the purpose.) Sketch out the figure of a
skeleton on a piece of cardboard and arrange
it after the manner of the dancing sailors and
other cardboard figures for sale in toy stores,
so that by holding the figure by the head in one
hand and pulling a string with the other, the
figure will throw up his legs and arms in a very
ludicrous manner.</p>

<p>Make the connections of the arms and legs
with black string and let the pulling-string be
also black. Tack the skeleton by the head to
the blackboard. The figure, having been cut
out is of course painted black, like the board.</p>

<p>Now to perform: Produce the board showing
only the side upon which there is nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Request that the lights may be reduced about
half, and take position at a little distance from
the company. With a piece of chalk make one
or two attempts to draw a figure; rub out
your work as being unsatisfactory; turn the
slate; the black figure will not be perceived;
touch the edge of the cardboard figure with
the chalk, filling up ribs, etc., taking care that
nothing moves while the drawing is progressing.
Then manipulate with the fingers. By pulling
the string below the figure it will of course
kick up its legs and throw about its arms, to
the astonishment of everybody.</p>

score cards.</p>

<p>In the centre of each table, place a bowl
containing one hundred peanuts in the shell, and
lay a long, new, common hat-pin at each place.
At the head table have a bell. Before being
seated to play, each guest is to have the right
hand securely tied down to the side by a ribbon
or fancy cord. When ready to commence, a
player rings a bell at the head table, and all
begin to spear nuts from the bowl; when the
bowl is empty at the head table, the bell is
rung and all count to see how many nuts they
have, the two having made the best score,
progress, first replacing the nuts into the bowl
ready for the next game; the cards are then
punched according to the score and the game
proceeds.</p>

<p>Five hundred may be the score limit, the
one who first gets the five hundred winning;
or it may be decided to have the game end
when the players at the head of the table return
to that table, or at least two of them.</p>

<p class="section"><b>Your Friends in Black.</b> There are various
advantages about a silhouette party. It admits
of no small amusement, for occasionally the
queerest object may be twisted to fit a name.
The first thing to do is to prepare a list of your
guests and find for each name something that
will represent it. Set the wits of the entire
family at work, for on this task two heads are
infinitely better than one.</p>

<p>The longer time you have for the “rebusing”
of the names the more entertaining the
list will prove. Do not leave out a friend because
at first it seems almost impossible to picture
his name. The same license is allowed for a
rebus as for poetry, and a point may be stretched
to make the drawing fit the name, although it is
not best to leave too much to the imagination.</p>

<p>For the mechanical part of the work provide
ragged-edged cards of various sizes. One name
will demand a long, narrow card for its representation;
another name, a square card. The
best surface for this purpose is a heavy, water-color
paper which is neither smooth nor rough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
Do not cut it. Crease it in such lengths as
you wish to use, then tear it with a very blunt
paper-knife. This gives an excellent ragged
edge. Take the designs you have planned to
use and trace them over black carbon copying
paper on each card, leaving a generous
margin. Sketch no detail except the mere
outline of a figure. Fill a pen with India ink
and go very carefully over the outline. Allow
it to dry; then with a rather stiff, small sable
brush dipped in the ink fill in the silhouette till
it is perfectly black and even. Allow it to dry,
and add in one corner the number which corresponds
with the list. There is a good deal to
learn in the adaptation of a design for a silhouette.
If a human figure is chosen let it
generally be in profile. As a rule, a full-face
figure, either in an animal or a man, is almost
meaningless unless it is full of action. When
the silhouettes are completed, they should be
pinned up in a conspicuous place, so that they
may all be seen and examined easily and prizes
awarded to the most successful guessers.</p>

<h2>GAMES</h2>


<p class="section"><b>Packing the Trunk.</b> A game adapted from
the French, that is very popular among the
little people of America, is a good test for the
memory.</p>

<p>The children must sit in a circle, and one,
as leader, announces in this fashion: “I pack
my trunk, and in it I put”—mentioning
some articles used in traveling, as gloves, brush
or cologne. The next child begins then, saying
what the leader has said and adding another
article, and so on around the circle, each child
repeating all the articles mentioned by the previous
one in their correct order, and then adding
one more to the list, which after a while assumes
lengthy proportions. If one boy or girl forgets
one article or puts it in the wrong order, he
or she must drop out of the game, and so on
until only one child remains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>


<p class="section"><b>Blowing Ping-pong Balls.</b> Arrange the players
with their hands behind them along the sides
of a long extension table, down the centre of
which a row of ping-pong balls are placed at
intervals of about two feet. Appoint two
judges and place them at the ends of the table.
At a given word, the players on both sides begin
to blow the balls, endeavoring to blow them
off their opponents’ side of the table and to
prevent any balls from being blown off of their
own side. Each ball blown off counts five
points. The game is 100 points.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Doing the Impossible.</b> A sure way to raise
a laugh among a party of friends, is to claim
that you can do an apparently impossible thing,
and then get your friends to try it; then, when
they have tried and failed, do the very thing
they failed on, in a simple way which has never
occurred to them. Here is a deception which
seldom fails to work and which always provides
a lot of fun, even to those who are fooled by it.</p>

<p>Begin by saying something about ant-eaters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
which have such long tongues that they can
touch the ground with them without lowering
their heads, and then ask one of your friends if
he can put out his tongue and touch his ear.
He will try, gently at first, then harder, and at
length make the funniest faces by trying to do
that, which is of course, impossible. Then
others will try poking their tongues out of the
corners of their mouths, and trying to curl
them around their cheeks until their ears are
reached.</p>

<p>When they have finished, you put out your
tongue, and touch your ear with your finger.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Game of “It.”</b> Here is a game that
will amuse any party, but you must first find
out adroitly that there is at least one person
in the company who has never been initiated
into the mysteries. This one is chosen to leave
the room, but before he goes he must be told
that those in the room will select an object
which he is to guess on his return. He may
ask as many questions as he wishes when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
time comes, one question at a time of each
person consecutively, but his questions must
be so worded that they may be answered by
“Yes,” “No,” or “I do not know.”</p>

<p>When all this has been explained, the guesser
leaves the room. The leader then arranges
the party in a circle, seating alternately a boy
with a girl, if possible, and explaining that each
person must think of the one sitting on his or
her left, as the object chosen, and answer all
questions as if they applied to that person.
You may imagine that the conflicting answers
arising from such an arrangement will confuse
the questioner, and much fun will be derived
by those in the secret.</p>

<p>For instance the questioner may ask of No.
1, who is a girl, “Has it life?” No 1 answers
“Yes.” He then asks No. 2, who is a boy, “Is
it pretty?” and No. 2 very naturally answers
“Yes,” for he is speaking of the girl at his left.
Then of No. 3, who is a girl, “Is it a girl?” and
No. 3, thinking of the boy on her left, answers
“No.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>All this throws the questioner off the track—it
has life, it is pretty, but it is not a girl. So
he naturally asks No. 4, who is a boy, “Is it a
boy?” and No. 4 answers “No.”</p>

<p>The questions will now be varied, to find
something with life that is pretty, and is neither
a girl nor a boy, and the result will be very amusing.</p>

<p>Or the questioner may ask such questions
as “Is its hair long?” “Does it wear short
sleeves?” and so on, and all the conflicting
answers will tend to prolong the game to any
desired extent.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Game of “Turtle.”</b> Here is a game for
boys who have good, strong muscles. It is
called “turtle.” Any number may play, and
the game commences by all sitting in a row
resting their chins on their knees, and each
holding his left ankle with his right hand, and
his right ankle with his left hand. This is a
very difficult position to keep. At a given
signal, the turtles start for a goal a short distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
away. It is the object of the game for
the turtles to waddle to the goal and back to
the starting point without removing their hands
from their feet. The winner is, of course, the
one who returns to the starting point first.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Game of “Empty Hands.”</b> Some member
of the household produces a quantity of
small cards. The number is not quite sufficient
to “go round” the company, an intentional
feature of the game. Four persons find themselves
empty-handed when the bell rings. This
bell is a signal for the passing, the object being
to find some one without a card and rid one’s
self of the one in hand by passing it on. No
one to whom a card is offered is allowed to
refuse it, unless, of course, he already holds
one. If empty-handed he is obliged to receive
the unwelcome gift and try to get rid of it as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Each time the bell rings which occurs at
irregular intervals, making it impossible to
calculate, the passing ceases, and all having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
empty hands win a point to count towards the
final prize. The boy or girl having most points
when the passing is over, receives a prize.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Simon Says.</b> The players are arranged in a
line, the player who enacts Simon standing in
front. He and all the others clench their fists,
keeping the thumb pointed upwards. No
player is to obey his commands unless prefaced
with the words, “Simon says.” Simon is himself
subjected to the same rules. The game
commences by Simon commanding, “Simon
says, ‘Turn up,’” on which he turns his thumb
upwards, followed by the other players. He
then says “Simon says, ‘Turn down,’” and
brings his hands back again. When he has done
so several times, and thinks that the players
are off their guard, he merely gives the word,
“Turn up,” or “Turn down,” without moving
his hands. Some one, if not all, is sure to obey
the command, and is subject to a forfeit. Simon
is also subject to a forfeit, if he tells his companions
to turn down, if the thumbs are already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
down, or vice versa. With a sharp player enacting
Simon, the game is very spirited.</p>

<p>The simplicity of this game constitutes its
chief charm, as the very fact of its being so
simple, sometimes leads to inattention on the
part of some of the players, which is sure to
result in their being caught.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Passing Bean-bags.</b> Make twelve or fifteen
bags, six inches square, of bed-ticking, and
loosely fill them with beans which have been
washed and dried to remove the dust.</p>

<p>Appoint two leaders, who choose sides, arranging
the sides in lines facing each other, with
a small table at each end of each line.</p>

<p>The bean-bags being equally divided, each
leader deposits his share upon the table nearest
him. Then, at a given signal, seizing one bag
at a time with one hand, with the other he
starts it down the line, each player passing it
to the next, until all the bags reach the last,
who drops them upon the table at his end of the
line. When all the bags have reached this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
table, the last player, seizing each in turn,
sends them back up the line to the leader, who
drops them upon his table. Whichever side
first succeeds in passing all the bags down the
line and back, wins the round. It takes five
rounds to make a game, so that three out
of five must be successful for the winning
side.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Buzz.</b> This is a simple little game that needs
no preparation, but can be started in a moment
when there is danger of dullness. A large company
can play equally as well as a small. The
leader instructs the company that they will now
proceed to count in regular order until they
come to seven, any multiple of seven, or any
number having seven in it, when they will substitute
the word “buzz” for that number.
Should they fail to do this they will be dropped
from the circle. This will continue until every
one has blundered. When the higher numbers
are reached it takes one quick in quantities
to follow it. Given properly it goes: 1, 2, 3, 4,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
5, 6, buzz, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, buzz, 15, 16,
buzz, 18, 19, 20, buzz, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, buzz,
buzz, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, buzz, etc.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Can You Laugh?</b> This is a little entertainment
that will fill in some vacant spot in an
evening, or will serve as an impromptu. It can
be tried either by the ladies or gentlemen. If
the ladies try it (and this is likely to be more
successful, as they laugh easier than men), let
them stand in a row. The gentlemen are then
to endeavor to make them laugh by every
means possible, except to touch or threaten
to touch. The least departure from perfect
soberness is called a laugh, and the lady is to
step out of the line and join the gentlemen in
her endeavor to make the ladies laugh. If it
is desired that a prize be given, it may be
given to the lady who keeps from laughing
longest.</p>


<p class="section"><b>An Optical Game.</b> Present a ring to a person,
or place it at some distance and in such a
manner that the plane of it shall be turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
towards a person’s face; and then bid him
shut one of his eyes, and try to push through
it a crooked stick of sufficient length to reach
it; he will very rarely succeed.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Blowing the Feather.</b> A simple and successful
game is this old-fashioned one. Having
provided a sheet or tablecloth and a small
feather such as sofa pillows are stuffed with,
ask your guests (all but one) to be seated on
the floor in a hollow square. The tablecloth or
sheet is then spread so that the players can
hold the edges of the sides and ends up, just
under their chins, thus stretching the cloth
taut about a foot and a half above the floor.
Upon the cloth the small feather is placed, and
the player who is left out of the square is then
told that he must do his best to catch it either
in front of or upon some one of the seated players,
who will then be obliged to take his place.
At a signal, the players on the floor begin to
blow, and the feather flies hither and thither,
never resting, while amid much laughter the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
player who is out flies hither and thither, too,
until he catches it at last on some unwary individual
or some one too weak from laughing to
blow quickly and effectively.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Throwing the Handkerchief.</b> Two sides being
seated in two rows facing each other, a
knotted handkerchief is thrown suddenly at
one of the players opposite, calling out at the
same time, either “Earth!” “Water!” “Air!”
or “Fire!” If “Earth” is called, the player
into whose lap the handkerchief falls must
name some quadruped before the other can
count ten; if “Air,” a bird; if “Water,” a fish;
and if “Fire,” he must remain perfectly still.
Should the player fail to name an animal, or
name the wrong one, or speak when he ought
to be silent, he must drop out of the game, and
the player who threw the handkerchief at him,
may take and throw it at some one else. But
should he answer properly, he must throw the
handkerchief at a player on the opposite side,
call an element and count ten. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
way the game goes on until all but one have
dropped out, the remaining one being the
winner.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Going to Jerusalem.</b> Get a line of chairs,
every other one facing an opposite direction,
one less chair than the number of people. As
the piano is played, they march around the line
of chairs, and as the music suddenly stops,
each one tries to sit on the nearest chair, and
of course some one is left standing and is out
of the game. The music starts again, and one
chair is taken out. The same thing is repeated
until there are two people left to one chair.
It is very amusing to watch these two cautiously
moving about this chair, ready to seize it the
instant the music stops.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Find the Whistle.</b> All the children but one
sit down in a circle. The one that is left standing,
must be the one who does not know the
game. Some one takes a string, fastens a
whistle to one end of it, and a bent pin to the
other, then quietly and secretly attaches the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
string by the hook to the person’s back. Every
time he turns his back toward any one, the
whistle is taken and blown. So it goes until
the whistle is discovered.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The All-around Story Game.</b> One person in
the room begins to relate a story, and after telling
enough to interest the hearers and arouse
their curiosity, suddenly breaking off, throws
a knotted handkerchief at some member of the
party, calling upon him to continue the story.
This is kept up as long as possible. The more
absurd and improbable the better. If any one
fails to respond upon receiving the handkerchief,
he or she must drop out. The one remaining
last wins.</p>


<p class="section"><b>An Obstacle Game.</b> Set stools, chairs, tables,
or anything that is an obstacle in the most
convenient place in the room; let those who
are to take part in the game have two minutes
to get their bearings. Then they leave the
room and come back blindfolded. In the
meantime, all the obstacles have been removed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
but the warning cries of “Look out!” and the
absurd attempts of the players to remember
where the obstacles were, make much fun.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Impudence.</b> This is played with two packs
of cards. Seat the players around the table
and deal to them, one at a time all around,
a whole pack of cards; placing the other pack,
face downward, in the centre of the table.</p>

<p>The first player begins by turning up a
card from the pack on the table, at the same
time asking some uncomplimentary question,
which is supposed to apply to the person holding
the corresponding card. This unfortunate
player has a speedy revenge, however, as it
is his privilege to turn the next card and ask
the next question.</p>

<p>Example: A [turning up card]—“Who is
the most selfish person in this room?”</p>

<p>B [who holds the duplicate]—“Evidently
I am, but [turning another card] who is the
most conceited?”</p>

<p>C—“That must be I. Now [turning card],<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
let us see who is the stingiest.” And so on
till the pack is exhausted.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Rolling Chase-ball.</b> Two teams may play
this game, and two big balls or footballs are
used. The teams line up in parallel rows, the
players not facing each other, but behind one
another all facing the same way. The leader of
each team holds a ball in both hands.</p>

<p>At the appointed signal, the leader, without
bending his body or turning his head, tosses
the ball backward to the player behind him.
The ball is tossed backward again, and so
passes along the line. The end player then
runs to the head of the line, and the whole process
is repeated over again. The end player
again goes to the front, and the game is continued
until the original leader of the team is
again at the head of his line. The team first
reaching its order of formation wins the game.</p>

<p>It is essential that the ball should travel
swiftly. Should any player drop the ball, he
must run for it and regain his place in the line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
before passing it on. Should a toss be so strong
as to pass above the player behind, so that he
fails to receive the ball, the ball must be passed
back so that the missed player shall handle it.</p>

<p class="section"><b>The Raised Hand.</b> Tell some person to pick
up a coin in one hand and hold that hand above
his head while he counts twenty, aloud and
slowly. Before the person picks up the coin,
you leave the room and return just after he
finishes counting, but not so soon that you can
see in which hand he had the coin. Nevertheless
you tell him correctly every time, which hand
he had raised. The way this trick is done, is
exceedingly simple. On entering the room,
after the person has counted twenty you look
at his hand. The one which he has raised
above his head will be white, as the blood has
run down from the fingers and hand; the other
one will remain its natural color.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Unconscious Movements.</b> Slit a match at
the wrong end and cut another one on the
slant. Now place one within the other, so
as to form an acute angle, and set these united
matches astride the blade of a dinner knife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Impress on the experimenter to allow the
phosphorus ends lightly to touch the table, but
on no account to move away from its surface.
The matches will now begin to march
along the blade. In order to render the experiment
more attractive, cause the two matches
to imitate the legs of a little man by placing
a painted puppet on top of them.</p>

<p>Another way: Take two straws from a stiff
broom. Cut one in half and fold each piece
into the shape of a hairpin. Place one astride
on each end of the long knife, which you hold
steadily, and if on a level surface they will walk
towards each other until they meet in the
middle.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Broken Match Restored.</b> The performer
requests a member of the audience to
give him an ordinary wooden match, first
marking the same for the purpose of identification.
He then wraps the match in a handkerchief,
in which condition he hands it to a
spectator with the request to break the match,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
still enclosed in the handkerchief, to pieces.
This is done, after which, the handkerchief
is shaken out and the marked match falls
from its fold quite restored.</p>

<p>The secret of this trick consists in having a
duplicate match concealed in the hem of the
handkerchief from the outset. The marked
match is simply lodged in the fold of the handkerchief,
the one in the hem being brought up
to the centre and put into the hands of the
spectator. It is, therefore, the one in the hem
that is broken, the hem serving to retain the
pieces, the marked match falling out as the
handkerchief is shaken. A silk handkerchief
with a narrow hemstitched border is the
most convenient to use, for the reason that the
broken match is the more readily removed
and a fresh one inserted for future occasion.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Cent and the Hole.</b> In a piece of stout
paper, cut a circle three-sixteenths of an inch
less in diameter than a penny. Ask any one
to pass a penny through the hole without touching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the coin or tearing the paper. Fold the
paper exactly across the centre of the hole,
and then take it in both hands and ask some one
to drop the penny into the fold. Let it rest
just over the hole, its lower edge projecting
below. Bend the corners of the paper slightly
upwards. This elongates the opening, and if
the movement be continued, the penny will
after a second or two fall through by the force
of its own weight. The paper remains uninjured.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Mysterious Reading.</b> The performer takes
a piece of paper about eight inches square
and tears a strip about two inches wide off of
each side, then tears these two strips in half.
This gives four pieces of paper, each two inches
wide and four inches long. Upon these pieces
of paper, he requests different persons to write
the names of persons who are dead. Taking
the remaining piece of paper, he tears into two
strips and each strip is torn in half. This
again gives four pieces of paper, the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
size as the other four. Upon these pieces of
paper, the performer requests other persons
to write the names of some living persons.
The holders of the pieces of paper are now requested
to fold them over twice and place them
in a hat. The performer takes these pieces
of paper from the hat, one at a time, and by
simply holding them upon the top of his head,
can tell whether the name is that of a live
person or a dead person, making such remarks
as cause it to seem the more mysterious.</p>

<p>To perform this, take any piece of writing
paper, eight inches square, and tear off both
outer edges (right and left) for the first two
strips. These two pieces of paper have now
one straight or smooth edge and one (the torn
edge) rough edge. Remember this. On these
pieces are to be written the names of the dead.
When you feel them on top of your head, if
they have a smooth edge and a rough edge
it is of course the name of a dead person.
The other piece of paper, when torn into two
strips, has both edges rough, and upon these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
pieces are written the names of living persons.
When you feel the paper on your head has no
smooth edge, both edges being rough, it must
contain the name of a living person.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Baffling Card.</b> Take an ordinary visiting
card and bend down the ends at right
angles to the card, about a quarter of an inch,
then laying it on a smooth table, ends down,
ask any person to blow it over. This seems
easy enough, but it may be tried for hours
without succeeding. It is, however, to be done
by blowing sharply on the table at some distance
from the card.</p>


<p class="section"><b>A Watch Trick.</b> Ask a person to think of
a number on the dial of a watch from one to
twelve, but not to tell you what that number
is. Then, with a pencil, you tap various numbers
on the dial and he counts the tappings
silently, beginning with the next number higher
than the one of which he thought. That is,
if he thought of the number five, he would count
silently six, seven, eight, nine, etc., or if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
thought of nine, for example, he would count
to himself ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, etc., etc.
When he has counted to the number “twenty”
he must say, “Stop,” and your pencil, or whatever
you are using to tap the watch, will be
on the number of which he thought but did
not tell you.</p>

<p>There is just one point about this trick for
you to remember. When you tap the face of
the watch with your pencil, you also count
silently, beginning with one and counting to
yourself, one, two, three, four, etc., etc. It
does not matter what numbers you touch for
the first seven, but the eighth tap must be on
the figure twelve, and then go around the dial
backward, the ninth tap on eleven, the tenth
on ten, the eleventh on nine, etc., until you
reach the one selected.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Silk From Paper.</b> “I have three pieces of
paper—red, white, and blue. I am going
to burn them. I light them first. I find they
burn better that way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>The conjurer has previously at least four
yards of red, white, and blue ribbons—twelve
yards in all—stitched together at one end, rolled
up, and placed under the top of the right arm.</p>

<p>The pieces of paper are picked up with the
right hand, and the ends are twisted together
tightly, otherwise the papers would burn too
quickly and scorch the conjuror’s hands. The
papers are held in the flames of the candle for
a second, and while they are burning, the conjurer
draws attention to his empty left hand, and
then to the fact that his right hand contains
only the burning papers. When the conjurer
is going to show that he has nothing concealed
in his sleeves, he draws up the right sleeve with
the left hand, and takes the ribbon from under
the arm.</p>

<p>Then in order to be able to draw the left
sleeve up with the right hand, he is obliged
to put the burnt papers into the left hand.
He draws up the left sleeve, closes his right hand
over his left, and then crushes the burnt papers.
In doing this he gets hold of the piece of silk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
with his right hand, and, bringing his right hand
slightly towards the body, and turning a little
to the left, he throws his right hand vigorously
forward and the ribbons unfold.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Obedient Ball.</b> A wooden ball about
two inches in diameter is given for examination.
A hole one-half inch in diameter runs
through the ball. A small cord is next passed
for examination. The performer runs the cord
through the hole in the ball, and causes the
ball to run up the cord, and stop wherever he
wishes it to. Again the ball and cord are handed
for inspection.</p>

<p>After the performer hands out the cord for
inspection, he lays it on his table, and after the
ball is duly inspected, the performer picks up
the cord and with it a piece of black silk thread,
and runs it through the hole in the ball with the
cord; the other end of thread passes out behind
the scenes to his assistant. Take one end
of the cord in one hand, and the other end
of the cord and thread in the upper hand. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
by pulling the thread taut, the ball will stop;
when it reaches the bottom of the cord, the
assistant pulls the thread, and causes the ball
to ascend. By dropping the black thread, all
can be examined once more, to the mystification
of all concerned.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Tricks with a Pen.</b> Can you write your
name with your left hand? It is a good thing to
know how, in case you ever hurt your right
hand.</p>

<p>Can you write a looking-glass letter? That
always amuses children; so if you have a friend
who is ill, send her a looking-glass letter to
cheer her up.</p>

<p>Practise by writing on a piece of paper held
front of a mirror, and soon you will find it is
quite easy to do looking-glass writing. Looking-glass
writing is done backward, so that
it looks all right when it is held to the mirror.</p>

<p>Also see if you can write your name backward—that
is, begin at the last stroke and go back
to the first—and as a last trick try to write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
your name upside down. That is not at all
easy, but copy your signature upside down and
you will be able to do it quite well after a
little practice.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Dice and Cup.</b> Take from the backgammon
board two dice and the dice cup or
shaker. Hold the cup in your right hand by
putting your thumb and second finger around
the bottom of it, at the same time holding
one of the dice with the tips of the same finger
and thumb. Next put the other die on top of
the one you are holding. You will, of course,
need the aid of your left hand in arranging
the dice and cup in your right.</p>

<p>Now, by a quick upward movement of your
right hand, send the top die flying up into the
air, and as it comes down catch it in the cup.</p>

<p>Now comes the real trick—to get the other
die in the cup also. If you try to do this by
throwing the die upward as you threw the first
one, you may catch it in the cup all right, but at
the same time you will be pretty sure to throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the first one out of the cup. As for catching
both together as they come down, you will
find that almost impossible. The proper way
to get the second die into the cup without
losing the one that is already there, is, to let
your hand drop suddenly, at the same time
letting go the die which you have been holding.</p>

<p>The die will drop too, but not as rapidly
as your hand, so that you will have no difficulty
in getting the cup under it and catching it.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Surprising Paper Bands.</b> Cut three
bands of paper about twenty-four inches long
and two inches wide. In preparing the first
strip of paper, simply gum the ends together,
for the second strip, twist once and gum the
ends together; for the third strip, twist twice
and then gum the ends together. Now cut
each of the bands in the centre lengthways and
notice the results. In twisting the papers, it
should be done unobserved.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Napkin-ring Trick.</b> While waiting for dessert
at dinner, it is fun for the family at table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to exchange tricks. One is the napkin-ring
trick. Holding your napkin-ring in one hand,
look from your glass tumbler to some large
object—say, the sugar-bowl,—pretending to
hesitate between the two, then pick up the
glass tumbler and say: “Safer to take the
smaller article.” Then look around, and say:
“Will any of you believe me when I say that
I can push this glass full of water through this
napkin-ring?” Something may be added about
a newly discovered way of compressing glass.</p>

<p>Then you should set the glass down solemnly,
place your napkin-ring in front of it, and, with
an impressive flourish of your hand, thrust
your finger through the napkin-ring and give
the glass a shove.</p>

<p>“There!” you may exclaim in triumph,
“Haven’t I pushed the glass through the
napkin-ring?”</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Magical Cups of Tin.</b> This little trick,
performed in a parlor, will make you appear
quite a magician. Get beforehand two perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
plain tin cups, without handles and with
the bottom sunk about a quarter of an inch,
and straight sides. On the sunken bottom of
each put some glue, and over it drop some birdseed,
so that it looks as if the cups were full,
whereas they are really standing upside down
and the layer of seed is glued to the outside
of the bottom.</p>

<p>When you are ready to perform the trick,
have a bag of the same kind of seed, and,
standing off from your audience, hold the cups
so that they can see that they are empty, but
don’t allow any one to approach you.</p>

<p>Now take one cup and dip it into the bag
of seed, but instead of filling it, turn it upside
down, so that when you take it out the seed
glued to the bottom will show, and every one
will think it is full.</p>

<p>Place the apparently full cup of seed under
a hat, but in doing so dexterously turn it so
that the empty cup is upright and the glued
seed at the bottom. Don’t let your audience
see this turn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>Now take the other cup, which is empty, and
let them see you put it under another hat, but
also turn this one, so that they do not see you
do it. This brings the seed to the top and shows
an apparently full cup, and when you remove
the hat, after pronouncing some magic words,
it will look as if the cups had changed places.</p>

<p>Remove the cups before any one has a chance
to examine them.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Elusive Cork.</b> Lay any bottle of fair
size with an open mouth on its side, and lay
in the mouth of the bottle a piece of cork about
the size of a pea. Ask any of the spectators to
try to blow the cork into the bottle, and, try
as they may, they will find that they cannot
do it, as the piece of cork will always fly back
in the face of the blower.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Three Pennies.</b> Three pennies are
placed flat on the table, two tails and one head.
The two tails are together and the head penny
is some inches away. The coin with the head
upwards must be placed between the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
two coins without the tail penny nearest the
head being taken away, and the other coin
must not be touched. People not in the secret
will not attempt to solve the problem, as they
say it cannot be done.</p>

<p>This seemingly impossible trick is quite
simple once you have learned the secret. Throw
the head penny flat with some force, striking
the tail penny nearest, at the same time holding
the coin. This action will shoot the second
coin (which you must not touch) and throw it
some distance away. All that is left to be done
is to put the head penny between the two coins.</p>

floor in front of him, about a foot distant from
his toes, and tell him it is his if he can pick
it up without moving his heels from against
the wall. In vain will he try to get the coin
under the conditions prescribed, for this feat
is another of the impossible ones.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Drawing Matches to Win.</b> Take 15 matches,
bunch them up so they cannot be easily counted,
lay them on a table, and tell some person
that you will allow him to start the game,
by drawing from the pile one, two or three
matches—but no more. Tell him that you
have the same privilege, and that you intend
that he shall draw the last match, or, at least,
that you will leave the last for him to draw.</p>

<p>If you watch your turns carefully you will
succeed perfectly, unless, of course, your opponent
is acquainted with the system—and
very few persons are.</p>

<p>If he should first draw one, you draw one.
If his second draw should be three, then you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
draw one again. Observe now that there are
six drawn. In order to assure yourself of winning,
make certain that this is the case either
at your first or second draw—get six off the
board. Then there are nine remaining. The
next time you draw let it make four with what
he draws, leaving five still to be drawn. Now
if he draws three, you take one; if he draws two,
you take two, and so on. You will thus see that
the last match will always be left to your
opponent.</p>

<p>He will now surely want to try it again. This
time you begin the drawing by taking one,
as he did at first, making a remark to that
effect. Whatever number he takes, it cannot
make the six. But should he follow your
example and take but one, you still must be
careful and trust to luck and careful computation,
taking only one more on your second
draw, which will make three off. The chances
are small that he will take the remaining
three to make the six. But if he does,
it is an evidence that he is “getting on,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and he may possibly (but not probably)
beat you.</p>

<p>Whether he does or does not, you simply
let him start out again, and you proceed to
follow according to his lead. You will defeat
him nine times in ten without your being
compelled to make your play certain, which
can be done when you get your first draw, as
follows: draw two; he cannot then defeat
you, for whatever he draws, he will still leave
from one to three for you, and you take the
sixth off, when the rest is easy. Better not do
this until he is quite sure that he has “discovered”
your method, when this will put him
all at sea again. This game is great fun, and
will puzzle all of your friends.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Eye-Errors and Ghosts.</b> A few experiments
with the eyes will be found very interesting,
and to the uninitiated, very queer. If you will
hold up your forefinger about a foot from your
face, and look at a tree or object beyond it, or
at any tall object, you will see your finger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
double. Then look directly at your finger and
you will see the tree double.</p>

<p>The explanation is that each eye sees separately,
and when both are looking at the finger
the right eye sees the tree or object on the right
side of the finger and the left eye sees it on the
left. When, however, you look at the tree
directly with both eyes, each eye sees the
finger apparently in a different place. If you
will cover the one eye and look with the other,
you cannot see either the tree or the finger
double, which is the proof of the experiment.</p>

<p>Place two bits of white paper about a foot
apart on a table. Cover the right eye and look
steadily at the right-hand piece of paper with
the left eye. By stepping backward you will
reach a spot where the left-hand piece of paper
will disappear. You can make the right-hand
piece of paper disappear by looking at the left-hand
piece of paper with the right eye.</p>

<p>When you have made one disappear in this
way, move your head ever so slightly backward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
or forward, and the paper will instantly reappear.
The reason of this is that every person’s
eye has a blind spot on the retina, and
when an image of the piece of paper falls on
the spot it cannot be seen.</p>

<p>Instead of snatching the paper away after
looking at it steadily, look up at the ceiling,
and the image will be seen there. These
“ghosts,” as they are sometimes called, are
caused by the action of light on the retina of
the eye.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Detaining Hand-clasp.</b> Grasp a person
firmly by the wrists as if you were about to
handcuff him, and say that you can clasp his
hands in such a way that he cannot leave the
room without unclasping them. Probably he
will look sharply at you for a while, trying to
divine your purpose, and if you maintain your
firm hold on his wrists, he will be led to believe
that you intend to use your strength for the
purpose.</p>

<p>Then lead him to a table and seating him on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
a chair by it, clasp his hands about one of the
legs. Of course, he cannot now leave the room
without unclasping them unless he overturns the
table or drags it with him.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Pictorial Nail.</b> By having in your
possession an extraordinarily strong magnet,
you can perform the following very effective
trick. Prepare a large frame with a paper
centre, now take a crayon and draw a nail or
a hook, then borrow a key or key-ring and make
the announcement that you will hang one of
the articles on the picture. This is easy if you
have an assistant in the rear, with the
magnet attached to a stick, which he holds
directly in the rear of the drawn picture,
the magnet holding the article on the
front.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Cane Trick.</b> Measure the length of your
forearm along a cane by placing your elbow

<p>Take hold of your cane with your middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
finger, covering the mark, and your little finger
nearest to the head. The cane must be at right
angles to the hand and be grasped firmly so
that the tips of all the fingers are pressed tightly
against the palm of the hand. It is not “fair”
to hold the cane obliquely.</p>

<p>Now try to put the head of the cane to your
lips. If you succeed you are an exception to
the general rule, and even you will probably
fail if you hold the cane, in the same manner,
at a point a little further from the head.</p>

<p>But any one can do the trick easily by
holding the cane at a less distance from its
head than the length of his forearm.</p>

<h2>PANTOMIMES</h2>


<p class="section"><b>General Directions.</b> The best place for a
pantomime show is where two rooms are
connected by folding doors. A screen or curtain
can be fitted to this opening. Care should
be given that this screen fits the opening so
that no light can show over the top or from
around the sides or bottom. If the screen does
not fit, this can be remedied by hanging some
curtains or other draperies at the top and on
the sides, and by putting carpets or rugs at
the bottom.</p>

<p>Now for the screen. This is a sheet or square
of muslin or light-colored calico, tacked on a
light wooden frame or to the opening. The
cloth must be stretched tightly, as any wrinkles
spoil the effect of the shadows. Dampen
your cloth before tacking it on the frame, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
then pull it as tightly as you can before tacking;
when it dries, it will be found to have drawn
tightly, and will be free from seams or wrinkles.</p>

<p>If you desire to have the shadows show up
sharp and clear, make your screen semi-transparent
by painting it with a solution of paraffine
wax, dissolved in spirits of turpentine.
This, of course, should be done at least twenty-four
hours before your show is to take place,
so as to give it a chance to thoroughly dry.</p>

<p>Your theatre is now ready, all but the light,
and that is prepared and used as follows:
First, secure a large lamp, and then a large
pan, which is filled with sand; the lamp is to be
in the centre of this pan, and the reasons for
this precaution are obvious, as, should the lamp
be accidentally overturned, it will not ruin the
floor covering, as the oil will be absorbed by
the sand; besides it obviates the risk of a fire
or explosion.</p>

<p>You are now all in readiness for your performance.
The light is placed upon the
floor about four feet from the centre of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
screen on the actors’ side of same; the other
side of the screen, where your audience sit,
is, of course, in complete darkness, otherwise
the shadows of the actors would not be in
evidence.</p>

<p>Every one not engaged in the performance,
but who is behind the screen, waiting for
his part, must be particular to keep back of
the light, so their shadows will not be thrown
on the screen.</p>

<p>In making entrances and exits, come on
from the sides, about two feet from the screen,
and you must remember that the farther you
are from the screen, and the nearer to the light,
the larger will be your shadow on the screen.
Recollect, too, that you must be in profile, or
sideways to your audience, otherwise the effect
of your acting is lost; as in case you face
your audience your actions are all lost to
them.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Aerial Figures.</b> A very funny entrance can be
made by jumping over the light, which gives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the appearance on the screen as if you had
just dropped through the ceiling, and an exit
by jumping over the light looks like flying
up there again in a most weird manner. A
dummy figure (suppose that of a witch, riding
on the conventional broomstick) is suspended
by a fine thread or wire on the side of the screen
remote from the spectators. Behind this are
ranged, one behind the other, and at right angles
to the screen, a row of lighted candles. Being
all in the same line, they throw one shadow
only on the screen. The figure is now made to
oscillate slightly, so as to impart some little
motion to the shadow. One of the candles is
now removed from its place in the row, and
waved gently about, now high, now low, the
effect to the spectators being that a second
shadow springs out of the first, and dances
about it on the screen. A second and third
candle as it leaves its place in the line produces
a separate shadow. It is well to have
three or four assistants, each taking a candle
in each hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>


<p class="section"><b>Silhouettes.</b> The idea of projecting silhouettes
with the hands on a wall or illuminated
screen is an old one. These shadows are best
made on a screen, which is illuminated by a
single lamp enclosed in a projecting apparatus,
using acetylene gas. The lens must consequently
be of very short focus. The electric light
may be replaced at the amateur’s house by a
lamp, or better by a wax candle. The candle
will do very well in a small room where one can
be in total obscurity except for the candle light.
The chief fault of this light for shadowgraphy,
is, that the distance from light to screen
must necessarily be short, or shadows will not
be sharp. The oil lamp should not be used if
another better light can be obtained, because
the shadows must necessarily be somewhat
blurred. The main thing to be studied in the
selection of a light is to get a brilliant point
of light and not necessarily a large surface.
Now, an oil lamp, having a large or probably
double flame, has too large a surface of illumination.
Moreover, the rays should always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
travel uninterceptedly to the screen, never
through the glass, and never thrown from a
reflector. Seeing that a glass chimney and reflector
are almost indispensable to an oil lamp,
there is abundant reason for not using it. If
the lamp is used, turn the edge and not the
flat side of the light before the screen.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Shadow Pictures</b> may be accompanied by a
phonograph. Care must be taken in arranging
the lights so that the shadows of the actors
may be clear cut and not out of proportion to
the size of the sheet on which they are thrown.
The concealed phonograph starts, and presto!
the shadow actors behind the sheet seem to be
the very embodiment of the voices of the
records. It is difficult to realize that a machine
is talking. Especially is this true when the impersonators
are sufficiently familiar with the
words as to be able to form them with their lips,
although not really uttering them.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Shadow Show.</b> One of the most pleasurable
forms of entertainment, in which every boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
and girl takes delight, is the shadow show,
and a home-made one can be easily constructed
and varied to your heart’s content, if you are
at all ingenious.</p>

<p>First secure some light strips of wood one
inch thick and two inches wide; you will need
two of these six feet long and two of them three
feet long. These are to be joined together,
making a frame six feet high by three feet wide.</p>

<p>Next secure two strips one inch thick, one
inch wide, and three feet long, and two strips
of the same size, but one foot long. Attach the
one-foot pieces to the three-foot strips six
inches from each end.</p>

<p>This frame is to be attached to your larger
frame, twelve inches from the top.</p>

<p>Your framework should be joined so that it
presents a flush, smooth surface at all of the
joints of the two frames. Over your large
framework you will now tack or glue black
paper or muslin, leaving the opening made by
the smaller frame to be covered by white muslin,
making a semi-transparent screen 12 × 24<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
inches, upon which are to be shown the
figures.</p>

<p>A piece of tape is stretched across the bottom
of the screen, close to the frame. This
holds against the frame the figures used in
the show and at the same time allows a continuation
of their feet in the cardboard from
which they are cut to project below, and so be
held by the exhibitor.</p>

<p>By means of these continuations below the
feet, the exhibitor can make the figures glide
along, rock backward and forward, or suddenly
disappear by pulling them downward.</p>

<p>All the figures should be cut out of cardboard
and should have the projection or continuation
of the feet. Scenery can be cut out
the same way, and is quite easy, as you only
need side screens. The scenes can be held
by the tape strip or can be fastened to the
sides by using thumb tacks. The joints of the
figures are made with bits of broom wire. If
you want the eyes of the comic figures to roll
about, string a glass bead upon a thread and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
insert in a place cut for eyes in the figure;
fasten the thread at either side with a bit of
glued muslin. During the performance, this
screen is illuminated by placing a light about
three feet behind it; the room in which the
audience is seated being, of course, dark. To
shut out any light that may shine out at the
sides or top of the doorway, you should hang
shawls or strips of your black paper muslin.</p>

<p>Humorous and grotesque pictures may be
cut out of newspapers and magazines, pasting
them on cardboard and then cutting out the
cardboard. The show may be a pantomime or
the exhibitor may speak for the different
characters. All the figures to be used should
be placed on a table or a chair near the exhibitor
or held by an assistant. With a little ingenuity
you can make the figures so that the
arms and legs and head work on pivots, attaching
them to thread so small that it will
not cast a shadow on the screen. There is
hardly any end to the amusement you may
have in this way.</p>

<h2>CARD TRICKS</h2>


<p class="section"><b>Calling the Cards.</b> To begin with, allow the
pack of cards to be thoroughly shuffled. When
the pack is returned to you, adroitly notice
the value (suit and denomination) of the bottom
card, which we will suppose happens to be
the four of spades.</p>

<p>Now, with apparent carelessness, throw the
cards face downward on a table and scatter
them about with your fingers. However, you
must not lose sight of the bottom card, and
wherever your fingers may push it your eyes
should follow also, in order that you may know
exactly where it lies. The spectators, meanwhile,
are unaware of this knowledge on your
part.</p>

<p>Say to those present: “I will now present
to you a mystery which is apparently very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
simple, yet to my mind is a profound problem.
It is one of those mental wonders that cannot
be readily understood, and the deeper we study
into them, the farther we seem to be from the
truth. You will therefore observe closely and
see what you see.”</p>

<p>You continue: “I have, as you probably
noticed, allowed Mr. —&mdash; to shuffle the cards
thoroughly and they have been scattered over
this table at random. I shall allow five cards
to be selected and I shall endeavor to name
each one before it is taken up. In order that
nobody’s attention may be distracted, I shall
hold the cards taken up until the entire five
have been selected. To prevent any mistake,
let some person write the names of the cards
upon a paper as they are called and see if
I am correct.”</p>

<p>You will then remark: “I will now call for
cards, one by one and shall ask Mr. Brown
(any person desired) to make the first selection.
Mr. Brown, you will please find for me the
four of spades, without turning the card over.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Naturally Mr. Brown smiles and says that
such a thing is impossible. You ask him, however,
to simply rest his fingers upon the back
of any card his fancy may dictate. Having
touched a card, you carefully draw it away from
the table, making sure that its face cannot be
seen. Hold it in your hands, close to your body,
in an easy, unsuspicious manner, just as if
you were confident the four of spades had been
selected. Let us suppose, however, that the
card is the seven of hearts. You remark:
“I will next ask Mr. Jones to touch a card in
the same manner as did Mr. Brown, but I
predict beforehand that it will be the seven
of hearts.” The card is tapped, and you pick
it up, as before. Let us suppose this second
one is the ace of diamonds. If so, you ask
Mr. Smith to touch a card, which you expect
to be the ace of diamonds. This, you notice,
happens to be the queen of hearts. You then
ask Mr. Robinson to touch a card, which you intend
shall be queen of hearts, and after he does so
you secretly ascertain that it is the eight of clubs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Up to the present moment, four cards have
been chosen. For the fifth time, you are to
have a card selected “by chance.” You decide,
however, to save time, that you will try
your own luck and see if you can pick out the
eight of clubs. In doing this, you allow your
finger to rest, with apparent carelessness, upon
the real four of spades, the position of which
you have known all the while. Having picked
up the four of spades, you place it with the
others in your hand.</p>

<p>You are now able to produce the five cards
you have named beforehand, viz.: four of
spades, seven of hearts, ace of diamonds,
queen of hearts and eight of clubs. The effect
upon spectators is indeed surprising.</p>

<p>Much depends upon the tact which you employ
in executing this trick. You should first
impress it in an indirect way upon the minds
of those present, that your experiment is one
of actual prevision. It is one of the rules of
magic to lead the thoughts as well as eyes in
a wrong direction. Be careful in picking up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the cards. Do not let any one who is to touch
a card get ahead of you by turning it over and
thus exposing your trick. In looking at the
card after you have taken it into your hand,
do so adroitly—don’t stare at it. As the
success of the trick depends upon knowing the
location of one card, do not make a mistake on
that one.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Odd Card.</b> Request one of the company
to place both hands flat on the table, then insert
between each two fingers of his right hand,
two cards or one pair at a time; this will require
four pairs of cards. Follow the same
method with his left hand but place a single
card instead of a pair between the third and
little finger. This will require three pairs and
an odd card or fifteen cards in all. Now take
the two cards which are between the third and
little finger of his right hand and lay them down
on the table, separately, side by side, at the
same time saying, “That is one pair.” Then
take the next pair, separate the two cards and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
lay one on each of the cards already on the
table and say, “There is another pair.” Follow
exactly the same method with the remaining
pairs, making the same remark with each
until only the odd card remains. When you
come to the one card, hold it in your own hand
so that every one may see it. “Now,” explains
the performer, “we have two heaps
containing an even number of cards. I have
one card in my hand. If I place this odd card
on either of the two even packs, it will make
that pack odd, will it not?” The audience
appealed to in this manner will respond in
the affirmative. “Now on which pack shall
I place this odd card?” The card is placed
on the packet selected. “Will some one in the
audience kindly hold this odd packet?” continues
the performer, handing the packet to
a lady or gentleman. “I shall hold the even
packet. My trick is this: I shall undertake
to pass one card from my packet which contains
an even number of cards to the odd packet,
held tightly by your representative. Ready!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Hold tightly, sir. One, two, three! Did you
feel the card as it struck the pack? No?
Well, sometimes the impact is imperceptible.
But the card has arrived nevertheless. Will
you count the cards in your packet? Wait
a moment, sir. In the beginning you had the
odd packet, I believe? And now, (Spectator
counts the cards) you hold the even card number
while I have the odd number! (Performer
counts the cards in his packet.) Isn’t it wonderful?”</p>


<p class="section"><b>Naming the Cards.</b> Divide a pack of cards
in halves, and place these back to back, when
one half will be visible to the audience and
the other half to yourself. Glance quickly at
the card facing you, and then place the cards
behind your back. Place the card you saw
over the card shown to the company, show the
cards, and call the right card. This will give
you an opportunity of seeing the next card.
Produce as before, and do so until you have
come to the last. It is best, in performing this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
trick, only to keep a few cards turned towards
yourself, so as not to tire the company and
possibly lead them to guess how you do the
trick.</p>


<p class="section"><b>A Diamond Ace of Hearts.</b> Show the ace
of diamonds, the ace of spades, and the ace of
clubs, and lay them face downward on the
table. Pick up one ace, which you place in
the middle of the pack: the second ace at the
bottom, and the third ace at the top of the
pack. Then ask a spectator to cut the pack
wherever he or she may like, and no matter
where the pack is cut, the three aces will be
found together.</p>

<p>Commence by withdrawing the four aces from
the pack: the ace of diamonds you secretly
place on top of the pack, and arrange the other
three aces fan-wise as follows: the ace of
hearts must be inverted, and with the other
two cards, hide the lower part of the heart and
the small heart in the indicator. Show the
three cards thus arranged quickly, and no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
will imagine that the centre card is not the ace
of diamonds.</p>

<p>Lay the three aces face down on the table,
still arranged fan-wise, pick up the centre card,
which is really the ace of hearts, and without
letting any one see its face, slip it anywhere in
the pack; place the second ace at the bottom
of the pack and the third, after showing it,
on top, of course covering the ace of diamonds
which is already there. It does not signify in
which place the pack is cut, the three aces
will be found together when the two parts of
the pack are reunited.</p>


<p class="section"><b>A Three-card Trick.</b> This requires the aid
of three persons. Take three cards, and, holding
them in front of the first person, request
him to choose one and think of it. Then lay
the three cards, face down, in a row on the table,
and take three more cards, which show to the
second person, and tell him to remember one
of them. Place these cards on top of the other
three, and ask the third person to think of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
one of a third lot, which you show him; then
lay the last three cards on top of the others.
You now have three packs of three cards each.
You lift one pack at a time, and request each
of the three persons to inform you which pack
contains the card he thought of. Of course, you
know that the first person’s card must be at the
bottom of one of the packs, the second person’s
card in the middle, and the third person’s
card on top.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Detection by Smell.</b> This may be played
upon some one who will take no offence at the
result. Allow the person to shuffle the cards,
and then to select any one card, returning the
pack to the performer. Ask the person to
remember the card and to show it to the audience.
While this is being done, the performer
turns his back, stating that he does not want to
see the card or get any clue as to what it is.
While in this position, the bottom card of the
pack is turned up—and the top card turned
down. Turning around, he asks the person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
who selected the card, to hold it for a few seconds
between the hands, saying that the card
will be found by the sense of smell. The performer
now asks some one in the company to
procure a hat. Place it, crown down, a little
distance from any one.</p>

<p>Holding the pack tightly, the person holding
the card is now asked to thrust it into the pack
wherever he likes. The performer now puts
the pack in the hat and, taking out a few
cards, commences to smell of each one. Pushing
the cards around, the chosen card will be
seen with its back the wrong way. When ready,
take this card, smell of it, with appropriate remarks
show it, as the chosen card.</p>

<p>For a sensational conclusion, you may bring
the discovered card to the top of the pack,
and ask the person who selected the card to
grip the pack tightly by a corner, between the
thumb and first finger of the right hand, the
thumb extending about half-inch and the finger
more, and turn the cards face uppermost. The
selected card is now, of course, at the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
or lower portion of the pack. Suddenly hit
the pack a strong downward blow, which will
knock all the cards on the floor, except the one
selected, which will be left in the grip of the
party who selected it, staring him in the face.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Naming a Drawn Card.</b> The conjurer, having
shuffled the cards, asks a member of the
audience to abstract any card he pleases, to
look at it, and impress it firmly on his mind.</p>

<p>While he has been talking, the conjurer has
been squaring up the cards, and he now holds
up the pack between the thumb and second
finger of his left hand. Any other way than
this of holding the cards will do equally well
so long as the audience can see that the cards
are properly squared up. The chooser now
returns his card to the pack.</p>

<p>The conjurer then places the cards behind
his back, draws away three, throws them on
the table, and asks the chooser if his card is
among them. The answer is “No.” The
process of throwing three cards at a time on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the table is repeated until the chooser says that
his card is among the three exposed cards. The
conjurer then names the card.</p>

<p>The explanation is that when the card is
returned to the pack, the conjurer is careful to
notice where it was returned, whether near
the top, middle, or bottom of the pack. We
will suppose that it was near the middle. The
conjurer places the pack behind his back and
draws off three cards at a time from the top
of the pack until he has shown—say eighteen
cards. He will know that the selected card
was not among them. He then draws the top
card and the two bottom cards of the pack
for the next three, and he continues in this
way until the chooser says that his card is
among the three. The conjurer then knows
at once that it is the top card of the three,
because the other cards have come from the
bottom of the pack, and the chosen card has
been replaced near the middle of the pack.
If the chosen card is inserted near the middle
of the pack, several cards from the top may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
immediately placed on the bottom of the pack
to save time.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Grouping the Kings.</b> Select the four kings
from a pack, and also two jacks. The kings
you arrange in the shape of a fan, and place
behind the second one the two knaves, therefore
they are hidden from view. You show the
cards by holding them towards the audience,
so that they may be satisfied that the cards
really are kings. Square them together so that
one king will be on top, then the two jacks
and then the three kings, and place them on
the top of the pack. You may remark, “Ladies
and gentlemen, I propose to separate these
kings, the first (which you hold towards them),
I will place at the bottom of the pack, the
second, (which is a knave) I will place a little
higher up, the third (also a knave) higher up
still, and the fourth (which you again exhibit,
for it is really a king) I will leave on top.”
The kings are now three, on top, and one at
the bottom of the pack; consequently, a single
cut will bring them together. After a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
unnecessary pressing, etc., one of the company
can cut the cards, and kings will be found to
be in company.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Detecting a Turned Card.</b> The picture
cards have commonly a narrow strip for the
border; this border is usually narrower at one
end of the card than it is at the other. Place
three or four of the picture cards in such a
manner that either all the broader or all the
narrower borders are placed uppermost. Request
a spectator to invert one of the cards
while you are not looking. When done, observe
the cards and you will easily see which card is
turned, as its narrower border now lies on a
level with the broader border of the other cards.
If they try to mystify you by turning none of the
cards, you will easily see that this is the case. If
the performer has a good memory, the border
may be placed any way, taking due care to
remember the positions.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Telling the Number of Transposed Cards.</b>
The performer allows a spectator to cut a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
pack of cards into two heaps. Now, while the
performer’s back is turned, the spectator is
requested to transpose any number of cards
up to ten, from one pack to another. Place
the two packets together and square up the
cards. The performer deals from the top of
the pack about twenty cards, throwing them
face downward on the table. The performer
now asks the number of cards transposed, and
after the spectator has replied, the selected
card is turned over, and the number of its
spots corresponds to the number of cards
transposed. Thus if three cards were transposed,
a three-spot would be turned up.</p>

<p>The explanation is as follows: The pack is
pre-arranged in this manner: on an ace, laid
face downward, place a deuce; on this a tray;
on this a four; and so on to ten; and then a jack,
queen, and king. These thirteen cards are on
top of the pack, and when the pack is cut,
the performer notes which packet contains
the arranged cards. He now requests some one
to select one of the packets, forcing the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
packet. That is, if he selects the bottom packet,
use that, if he selects the top packet, say “I
will take the other.” In any case arrange to
use the bottom packet. A spectator takes any
number of cards up to ten from the selected
packet and passes them on the other packet,
the performer turning his back while this is
done. The two packets are now placed together,
taking care that the packet on which
the transposed cards were placed is uppermost.
Now, no matter how many cards were placed
upon the arranged packet, the fourteenth
card from the top will always give the correct
number, so that in dealing off the cards, the
performer must not lose sight of the fourteenth
card. Deal off about twenty cards, throwing
them carelessly on the table, but allowing the
fourteenth card to be a trifle more exposed than
the others. This will facilitate the choice of
the card. The performer now asks the
number of cards transposed, and after the
spectator has replied, the selected card is
turned over, and the number of its spots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
correspond to the number of cards transposed.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Three Packets.</b> Tell a person to choose
as he pleases three cards from a euchre pack,
informing him that an ace counts for eleven,
a picture card for ten, and the others according
to the number of spots. When he has
chosen these three, tell him to put them on
the table and to place on each as many cards as
spots are required to make fifteen. That is
to say, eight cards would have to be put on
the seven of clubs, four cards on the ace, and
a five above the ten. Let him return you the
rest of the pack, and (while pretending to
count something in them) count how many
remain. Add sixteen to this number, and
you will have the number of spots in the three
bottom cards.</p>


<p class="section"><b>A Card Found at the Second Guess.</b> Offer
the cards to some person, and let him draw
one. You then hold the cards behind you,
and tell him to place his card on top. Pretend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
to make a great shuffling, but only turn that
card with its back to the others, still keeping
it at the top. Then hold up the cards with
their faces towards the spectator, and ask him
if the bottom card is his. (While doing so,
you inspect his card at your leisure.) He of
course denies it and then you again put the
cards behind you, turn over his card so it
will face with the others and begin shuffling
again furiously. “Let me do that,” he will
probably say; so, as you are perfectly acquainted
with his card, let him shuffle as much as he likes,
and then when you get the cards back again,
shuffle, and show him his own card.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Pocketing a Chosen Card.</b> The performer
exhibits four cards, held fanwise in his left
hand and requests a spectator mentally to
select one. The performer then takes one of
the cards and places it in his pocket. Upon
spreading the cards again the spectator’s card
is missing and the performer draws the mentally
selected card from his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Four cards are arranged as follows: king
of clubs, jack of hearts, jack of spades, and
queen of diamonds.</p>

<p>Behind the king of clubs, the top card of
the pack, arrange these three cards, queen of
clubs, king of spades and jack of diamonds.
At the outset, the seven cards can be on the
top of the pack, the last named three cards,
of course, on top of the king of clubs.</p>

<p>Give the pack a shuffle, taking care not to
disturb the seven arranged cards on top.
Rapidly count off these cards in such a manner
that the audience cannot see how many cards
you take. Arrange the king of clubs, jack of
hearts, jack of spades, and queen of diamonds
fanwise in the left hand, keeping the three extra
cards, the queen of clubs, king of spades and
jack of diamonds concealed behind the king
of clubs. It does not matter in what order the
suits of the three concealed cards are arranged.
The proper method of holding the fan of cards
is with the left side of the king (and the three
concealed cards) pressed tightly in the crotch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of the left thumb, the opposite edge being held
by the tip of the first finger of the left hand.
This will keep the cards from spreading and
bringing the trick to a premature and disastrous
conclusion. The other three cards of the
fan are held between the tips of the left thumb
and second and third fingers.</p>

<p>Turn your back to the spectators and hold
the fan high above your head, the faces of
the cards toward the audience, and request a
spectator to think of one of the cards. When
the choice has been made, square the cards,
inserting the little finger between the king of
clubs and the three cards back of it. Then you
say: “I shall now place one of the cards in
my pocket,” and, suiting the action to the
words, take the four cards you have just shown,
and holding them as one card, place them in
the pocket, leaving the three extra cards in
your left hand. Ask the spectator to name his
card. Let us suppose he chose the king of
clubs. The performer replies, “The king of
clubs? Ah, then I read your mind correctly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
for I placed the king of clubs in my pocket.
Let me show you first that the king has left
the pack.” The performer spreads the three
cards, the queen of clubs, the king of spades
and the jack of diamonds, on the table. He
then produces the desired card from the pocket.
As the order of the suits is known, this part
of the trick is a simple matter. If the chosen
card is the jack of spades the performer picks
out the third card. A little practice is necessary
in order to make the selection quickly,
for there must be no fumbling in the pocket.</p>

<p>The spectator will never detect the substitution
of the cards; for the ingenious arrangement
of the suits tends to confuse the mind.</p>


<p class="section"><b>To Pick Out a Card Thought Of.</b> Blindfold.
Take twenty-one cards and lay them down in
three rows with their faces upwards; i. e., when
you have laid out three, begin again at the left
hand and lay one card upon the first, and so
on to the right hand; then begin on the left
hand again, and so go on until you have laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
out the twenty-one cards in three heaps, at
the same time requesting any one to think
of a card. When you have laid them out, ask
him which heap his card is in; then lay that
heap in the middle between the other two.
This done, lay them out again in three heaps
as before, and again request him to notice where
his noted card goes, and put that heap in the
middle, as before. Then taking up the cards
with their backs towards you, take the uppermost
card off and reckon it one; take off another,
which reckon two; and thus proceed
until you come to the eleventh, which will invariably
prove to be the card thought of. This
trick may be done without your seeing the
cards at all, if you handle and count them
carefully. To diversify the trick, you may use
a different number of cards, but the number
chosen must be divisible by three, and the
middle card, after they have been thrice dealt
as directed, will always be the one thought of;
for instance, if done with fifteen cards, it must
be the eighth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>


<p class="section"><b>The Siamese Aces.</b> Two aces are removed
from the pack, which is then cut into three
packets. One of the aces is placed on the middle
packet, and while the performer is exhibiting
the remaining ace, one of the spectators
“maliciously” transfers a few cards from
either of the outside packets to the top of the
middle heap. The performer, not noticing
this disarrangement of the cards, places the
second ace on top of the first, and the two on
top of the middle heap, presumably on top of
the first ace, although the spectators, who
blithely imagine they are in a conspiracy against
the performer, know otherwise. The cards are
now dealt from the bottom, face upward, and
the two aces come together.</p>

<p>The solution of the mystery is as follows.
In taking out two aces—say the ace of clubs
and the ace of hearts, glance secretly at the
top card of the pack. For the purpose of explanation
let us assume that this “key” card is
the seven of spades. Now cut the pack into
three heaps so that the top part of the pack will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
form the middle heap. You must number the
heaps in your mind from left to right, 1, 2, 3.
The top card of the middle heap is the seven
of spades. Exhibit the ace of hearts, requesting
the spectators to remember the card, and
place it on the middle pile. While you are
exhibiting the second ace (the ace of clubs),
move a little distance from the cards, and at
this psychological moment, a friend, who acts
as your confederate, (although the audience
is not aware of the fact) transfers a few cards
from either No. 1 or No. 3 to the top of the
centre heap. You are, apparently, oblivious of
this manoeuver, and place the ace of clubs
on the No. 1 heap, concluding by placing No. 3
on No. 1 and these on the middle heap. Inform
the audience that you are about to illustrate
for their benefit the surprising amount of affection
that exists between cards of the same value.
For instance, kings associate with kings, queens
with queens, jacks with jacks, and aces with
aces; of all cards, you declare, the aces are the
most affectionate. Between them the bonds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of sympathy are so strong that if they are
separated only temporarily they will exert
every effort to be reunited. This sympathy is
especially strong between a red ace and a black
ace—between a club and a heart, a diamond
and a spade. In fact, each pair may be likened
to the Siamese twins, except that the bond is
sentimental rather than material. “You will
observe,” adds the performer, “that the ace
of clubs and the ace of hearts were placed in
different parts of the deck, but so strong is the
affection between these aces that I have not
the slightest doubt they are at this moment
reunited in some portion of the pack. Ah,
you smile incredulously; but I assure you that
what I say is literally true, and I am prepared
to make my assertion good. Observe, pray,
that I shall deal the cards one at a time on the
table, and when I come to one of the aces, the
other will be with it.” The spectators, knowing
that the cards have been disarranged,
smile in expectation of the performer’s discomfiture.
The conjurer proceeds to deal the cards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
from the bottom, throwing them face upward
on the table. When the “key” card turns
up the performer knows that the next card is
an ace. He slides this ace back with the third
finger of the left hand, and keeps on dealing
until the other ace appears, when he throws
out the first ace. A flashlight picture of the
company at this moment would reveal an interesting
study in chagrin.</p>

Of.</b> Arrange the first ten cards of a suit in
a circle. Request some one to think of one of
the exposed cards and to touch some other card
in the circle. Mentally add the value of the
card touched to the number of cards displayed
(10), and then ask him to count the cards backwards,
until the number you have given is
reached, beginning at the card touched, and
reckoning that card as the number thought of.
The card at which he stops will be the one
mentally selected.</p>

<p>For example, we will suppose the three was
the card thought of, and the six was the card
touched. Six added to 10 makes 16. Then
request the player to commence counting the
cards backwards mentally from the number
thought of (three) at the number touched (six)
and continue until 16 is named, touching each
card as he counts. With finger on six he mentally
says “three;” the five-spot he calls four;
the four, five; the three, six; the two, seven,
and so on up to 16. The mental count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
will end with the three-spot—the number
thought of.</p>

<p>The designation of this time after time, no
matter what card is chosen, will seem little
short of miraculous to the uninitiated, and will
prove an unfailing amusement.</p>

<p>Of course, the evolution of the number to
be counted—16 (or 10 added to whatever
card is touched)—must not be explained,
and the apparent haphazard choice of various
numbers, when the director says: “Now
count backward till you reach 20 this time,”
or “12,” or “try to find any law you can if
I say a little 19,” will not appear due to tact or
finesse, but to be the result of some mysterious
intuitive power.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Passing a Card to Top of Pack.</b> Take off
the top card of the pack and show it. We will
suppose it is the eight of hearts. Call attention
to it and put it back on the top of the
pack. Then, without exposing the face of
the card, take it off the top of the pack again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and put it in the centre of the pack. Do not
push it fully in until you have held the pack up
and shown that the card is what you said it
was—the eight of hearts. Then square up
the pack. Take off the top card and show it
to your audience. It is the eight of hearts
which has apparently jumped from the centre
of the pack, where you put it, to the top.</p>

<p>Some one may say, “You have two eights of
hearts.” Give the pack to be examined and
your friends will find that the pack is quite
regular.</p>

<p>To do this, arrange the pack in such a way
that the seven of hearts is on top, and the eight
of hearts above that. When you show the top
card you really slide off the two top cards together.
Hold them with the thumb at one end
and two fingers at the other and the first finger
at one side. If you bend the card slightly,
there will be less chance of any one noticing
that you are holding two cards. You call attention
to the fact that the top card is the
eight of hearts, and put the two cards, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
held as one, back on the top of the pack.
Then you draw off the top card, which is the
seven of hearts, and slip it into the centre of
the pack. Show part of the card just before
you push it way in, and if you contrive to keep
a finger over the index in the corner, nobody
will know that the card is not the eight of
hearts.</p>

<p>It is now in the hands of the performer to
make the rest of the trick as mysterious as
possible.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Trick of “Thirty-one.”</b> A trick often
introduced by sporting men for the purpose of
deceiving and making money is called “thirty-one.”
It is played with the first six cards of
each suit,—the aces in one row, the deuces
in another, the threes in another; then the fours,
fives, and sixes—all laid in rows. The object
now will be to turn down cards alternately and
endeavor to make thirty-one points by so
turning, or as near to it as possible without
overrunning it; the one who turns down a card,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the spots of which make thirty-one or so near
it that the other cannot turn down one without
overrunning it, wins. The chief point of this
trick, is, to count so as to end with the following
numbers, namely 3, 10, 17, or 24. For
example, we will suppose that you are to begin,
you would commence with 3, your opponent
would add 6, which would make 9; it would then
be your policy to add 1, and make 10; then,
no matter what number he adds, he cannot
prevent you from counting seventeen, which
number gives you the command of the trick.
We will suppose he adds six, and makes sixteen;
then, you make 24, then he cannot possibly
add any one number to count 31, as the highest
number he can add is 6, which would only
count 30, so that you can easily add the remaining
1, or ace, and make 31.</p>

<h2>SOAP-BUBBLES</h2>


<p class="section"><b>Blowing Soap-bubbles.</b> Secure a lot of
clean clay pipes, and to make your bubble solution,
take a preserve-jar and fill two-thirds
full of boiling water, add three ounces of finely
shaven Castile soap, a teaspoonful of sugar and
four tablespoonfuls of glycerine, shake this
mixture thoroughly and then strain it through
a piece of white cloth. Your solution is now
ready for use. Strawberry or cranberry juice
will make pink bubbles, and orange juice will
make yellow ones. Any color may be obtained by
the use of aniline dyes. It is better to let the
solution stand two or three hours before using.
Cover the dining-room table with a soft woolen
cover, place as many finger-bowls around as
guests, or one large bowl, and fill with the thick
soapy water. Have ready a good-sized wicket,
made by bending a wire and putting each end into
a bottle, so it will stand firmly. Place it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
in the centre of the table and request the
guests to choose sides. Present each boy
with a clay pipe and each girl with a fan, to
which is attached a tally card. Arrange the
boys and girls on opposite sides of the table.
The boy nearest the head of the table takes
the bowl and with his pipe blows a bubble.
His partner, or the girl opposite him, fans it,
endeavoring to make it go through and pass the
arch without breaking. If it passes successfully,
a gold star is placed on the tally; if
it breaks before reaching the arch, a green
star denotes the player’s failure. Each boy
may blow the number of bubbles agreed upon.
After receiving their stars, the boy and girl
pass to the foot of the table, and the next boy
and girl move up and try their skill at blowing
bubbles. The game is ended in six rounds.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Fantastic Soap-bubbles.</b> Ordinary soap-bubbles
are blown with a pipe, a straw, or small
horn of some sort. If a straw is used, split
one end into quarters, about one half-inch long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
and bend the parts back at right angles to the
straw. The horn should be larger at one end,
but, if you wish to obtain bubbles, as large as
your head, you must have recourse to objects
of quite different nature. Place around the
body of a bottle a piece of common wire, and
twist the ends together in order to form a handle
for the ring which is thus obtained. Steep this
ring in the soapy water. Take it out carefully,
and you will perceive that the ring is furnished,
on the inside, with a thin covering or skin of
soapy water. Now hold the ring vertically
before your mouth and blow gently but continuously
at the centre of the soapy covering.
Fashion two rings with handles out of plain
wire. The ring can be about six inches in
diameter. Cover one of the rings with felt.
With this ring and with practice, you can send
the bubbles away up into the air, and keep a
half-dozen floating at one time. Then blow
a big bubble, holding the empty ring with a
handle in the left hand, and under the pipe.
When the bubble grows large, it will stick to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
the ring. Now, carefully take out the pipe,
dip into the soapy water and put the bowl of
the pipe up inside of the ring into the big
bubble, and blow a small one inside. Then,
with a swing and a side movement, liberate
both bubbles into the air. It may take a few
failures to make a success of it. With two felt
rings, “battledore and shuttlecock” can be
successfully played with soap-bubbles. Take
a clay pipe, fill up with cotton wadding loosely
and keep in place at mouth of bowl by a wire
screen. Wet cotton with gasoline. Let the
bubbles float in air and light them with
candle, and they will explode with a big flame.
Smoke-bubbles may be made by blowing in
smoke after the bubble has been well started.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Rebounding Bubbles.</b> A good game is to
have a small sheet held by a number of children
and blow the bubbles upon this, then they
can be sent flying by drawing the sheet taut.
Many ways may be devised to make blowing
soap-bubbles attractive.</p>

<h2>FORFEITS</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Grasp</span> the right ankle by the right hand, and,
standing on the left leg, bend it until the right
knee touches the floor, then rise slowly to a
standing position again. The left hand must
be kept extended all the time and must touch
nothing. The right foot must not be allowed
to touch the floor, nor the ankle released from
the right hand.</p>

<p>A large bottle is placed on its side. The
forfeit payer is seated upon this, with the heel
of his right foot resting upon the floor and the
heel of his left against the toe of the right.
A good sized needle is then given him, and a
thread, which he must endeavor to pass through
the needle’s eye without losing his balance.</p>

<p>Set an ordinary chair front downward on
the floor in such a way that the legs and back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
are horizontal. Ask the forfeit payer to kneel
on the lower bar and to recover with his lips
an object placed on the other end of the chair.</p>

<p>To put one hand where the other cannot
touch it.—This is performed by grasping the
right elbow with the left hand.</p>

<p>To place an object on the floor in such a
manner that no one can jump over it.—This
is done by placing it close against the corner.</p>

<p>Hold an ankle in one hand and walk around
the room.</p>

<p>For a forfeit, a person is directed to compare
any one of the company to some object and
to explain in what way he resembles this
object.</p>

<p>The victim stands on a chair and is posed as
a living statue by members of the company
in succession according to their various and
sometimes very original conceptions, such as
placing the head, shutting one eye, opening
the mouth, placing the arm, hand, or foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
to suit the fancy, or make him assume any
position.</p>

<p>Place a stool on the floor against a wall.
Stand from the wall, with the feet twice the
width of the stool away. Stoop down and seize
the stool by the top in both hands and place
the top of your head against the wall, your
back being almost horizontal. Lift the stool
from the ground without assistance, or try,
at any rate.</p>

<p>Stick a pin in the centre of the crown of
a hat, allowing the head to project about
half an inch, and ask the forfeit-payer to extract
the pin with the teeth, the crown of the
hat being previously blacked with burnt cork.</p>

<h2>HALLOWE’EN</h2>


<p class="section"><b>Decorations.</b> On account of the great variety
of houses, decorations for Hallowe’en and the
arrangements for entertainment must be
planned according to the situation, and individual
convenience. The following are some
suggestions.</p>

<p>The party may be ushered into a room decorated
for the occasion with autumn leaves,
yellow pumpkins, and anything else that may
suggest itself to the host, and lighted with
pumpkin jack-o’-lanterns and candles. All the
lights are covered, some with red and some
with black gauze, cambric, or paper shades.
The openings of the doors and windows may
also be covered with red and black cambric.
False faces, as ugly as possible, are placed
about the room. Skulls of papier-maché are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
a great addition to the decoration, and bones
of any description, thoroughly cleansed, are
effective.</p>

<p>If there is an open fire, the host or an initiated
guest may place upon it, from time to time and
as surreptitiously as possible, chemical powders
that burn blue, green, or red. All the
lights are turned low, the room being lighted
only sufficiently to permit moving about without
falling over the furniture and to show
the decorations.</p>

<p>The room may be decorated with festoons
of drab yarn cobwebs, presided over with
great spiders cut from black and yellow flannel,
or imitation insects from toy stores.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Invitations</b> to the gentlemen should read,
“Please wear a black mask.” Those to the
ladies, “Please come as a ghost.”</p>


<p class="section"><b>Receiving Guests.</b> As the guests arrive,
they may be greeted by one or two huge ghosts
nine feet high in a conspicuous place. A small
goblin may be concealed behind the flowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
draperies of this ponderous apparition, swinging
the ghostly figure slowly forward to salute
each approaching guest. When the guests
arrive they are met at the door by a ghost,
and when the last one has arrived, they are all
ushered into this weird place. As the guests
go into this room, they should be blindfolded,
and have presented to them an old glove filled
with wet bran and chilled on ice. There may be
also a piece of wet fur and a prickly pin ball in
the hands of a ghost with instructions to quietly
touch with these uncanny objects, the hands
or faces of other guests. At the sound of a
muffled gong, the party is conducted to a chamber
of horrors. As each one enters this place,
a huge paper bag may be burst over his
head and a far-away voice be heard sounding
through a garden hose.</p>

<p>Running water splashing over a cow-bell
tied to a faucet will give the sound of rushing
water and also keep the bell tolling dismally.
Newspapers cut into strips and nailed to the
cross-beams dangle about the heads of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
victims, and a hidden electric fan sets the
papers in motion and adds damp breezes to the
charm of this pleasant region. The bandages
are now removed and alcohol and salt fires furnish
a dim light and give the party a ghastly
appearance. Great care should always be taken
in doing this. Some of the sights to be seen
are described in the following sections.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Heads of Bluebeard’s Wives.</b> This
effect is easily produced. A rod is extended
horizontally across the rear of the room, about
six feet from the floor; from this a sheet is hung,
the bottom reaching and tacked to the floor to
keep it flat like a white wall. Young ladies
standing at intervals behind the sheet protrude
their heads through perpendicular slits
cut at the proper height to suit the stature of
each lady; the upper part of the slit is fastened
closely around the throat by a pin at the back
of the neck. A strip of red flannel is fastened
around the throat where the neck comes in
contact with the sheet, and a few splashes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
carmine on the sheet below each head produce
the appearance of blood. The hair of each is
gathered up and fastened to the rod above
by a piece of ribbon. The face of each is powdered,
and the eyes, with a dash of lead-color
under them, are kept closed. At a little distance
off the effect is startlingly real.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Severed Head.</b> This always causes a
sensation and should not be suddenly exposed
to the nervous, but the operation is not so
terrible as might be imagined.</p>

<p>A large table, covered with a cloth sufficiently
long to reach to the floor all around and completely
hide all beneath, is placed in the centre
of the room. A boy or girl with soft, silky hair,
being selected to represent the head, must lie
upon his back under the table, entirely concealed,
excepting that portion of his face above
the bridge of his nose. The rest is under the
table-cloth.</p>

<p>His hair must now be carefully combed down,
to represent whiskers, and a face must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
marked upon the cheeks and forehead; the
false eyebrows, nose and mouth, with moustache,
must be strongly marked with black,
and the real eyebrows covered with a little
powder or flour. The face should also be powdered
to a death-like pallor, and the effect is
very startling.</p>

<p>The horror of this illusion may be intensified
by having a subdued light in the room in
which the exhibition has been arranged.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Ghost Stories.</b> The party can now return to
a suitable place for games. If the parlor is a
small one, each one is expected to tell a ghost
story.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Unearthly Look.</b> Take a half-pint of
spirits and, having warmed it, put a handful
of salt with it into a basin; then set it on fire
and it will have the effect of making every
person look hideous. This must be performed
in a room. Be careful that no sudden draught
blows the flame upon one’s clothing, or any
other inflammable substance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>


<p class="section"><b>Luminous Writing.</b> Fix a small piece of
solid phosphorus in a quill, and write with it
on paper; if the paper be then placed in a dark
room the writing will appear luminous.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Floating Candle.</b> Here is an amusing
and inoffensive diversion which looks very much
like one of our Hallowe’en games called “ducking
for apples.”</p>

<p>The young folks are ranged around a tub of
water in which a piece of candle is floating,
and a prize is offered to him, who, without
touching the tub with his hands, will remove
the candle from the water by his mouth alone.</p>

<p>This may look very simple and very easy to
most of my readers; but let them try it. This
trial they may make at home, with a bucket
of water instead of a tub, and a piece of India-rubber
instead of a candle; and they will be
surprised at the result. Bring your mouth as
close as possible to the article and inhale it
with your breath, while seizing it with your
lips. Apples may also be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>


<p class="section"><b>Ornamented Apples.</b> If you plan to hold a
Hallowe’en party next fall, you can prepare
a part of the fun this summer. Cut out in
stout cloth the initials of whomsoever you
intend to invite. Paste the initials securely on
the sunny side of apples. When the apples are
ripe, the initials will remain in light yellow on
a red background. The fun of eating fruit
marked with one’s own initials or monogram
will be an unusual one for your guests. Should
you have the detail of your party pretty well
in mind, you will readily think of a number of
devices which you may “appleize” in this
fashion. Witches, for instance, can be thus
“painted” on the fruit.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Finding the Candle.</b> This is an admirable
penance. The victim, having been shown the
position of the candle, is securely blindfolded,
and after having been turned around once or
twice, is requested to go and blow it out.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Full Moon.</b> An original moon can be
made from a cheese-box covered with cotton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
cloth, on which a very jolly face is painted.
This can be drawn up by a string and pulley,
and illuminated by a candle placed behind it.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Cabinet Manifestations.</b> The medium has
a boy with her about seven years of age and
quite small. He comes in with her, under her
skirt or cloak, and is not noticed. She enters a
cabinet, passes her hands through openings in
the sides of the cabinet and her hands are held
by a committee, or, her hands may be securely
tied together before going into the cabinet, and
all the usual cabinet work goes on. The boy
rings the bells, plays musical instrument, etc.,
etc. The cabinet is made of some black
material and the transparent gauze is of some
light color. The boy may be dressed all in
black.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Spirit Pictures.</b> The performer shows a
wooden frame, on which is a piece of cloth,
both sides of which are shown, and this is
placed on an easel. A lamp is then placed behind
a cloth, thus rendering it transparent and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
impossible for any one to touch from behind
without being seen. Lights are then lowered a
trifle, a little music, and a spirit picture is
slowly precipitated upon the cloth in colors,
this being visible to every one present.</p>

<p>For this experiment, procure the following
ingredients from some druggist: sulphate of
iron, for blue; nitrate of bismuth, for yellow;
sulphate of copper, for brown; make
solutions separately of each, by dissolving a
small quantity of each ingredient in warm
water. Now make a solution of prussiate
of potash, and put it in a bottle atomizer.
With a brush for each color, make a picture,
landscape, portrait or, anything you desire,
on a screen of unbleached muslin. When dry,
these are invisible. Show the screen and set
it on an easel in front of cabinet. Slightly
dampen the muslin and place a lamp back of it
on a chair, lower lights a trifle; your assistant
or medium in cabinet takes the atomizer, and
from behind sprays all over the back of screen
with the solution of prussiate of potash, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
slowly brings colors out. The effect is weird,
and, although perhaps not artistic, it is a novelty
and is apparently done by unseen agency.
If a light is placed at back of screen, the audience
can see that no one approaches the screen.
A little music covers the sound of the atomizer.
Always see that the atomizer is screwed up air-tight
before using it.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Parlor Magic.</b> Make a hole in one side of
each of six candles, cutting through until the
wick is severed. These holes must be at various
distances from the top—different in
each candle. Now, if you should light one of
these candles, it would burn steadily until the
flame got down to the hole, when the cut in
the wick would cause the candle to go out.
If you should light them all together they would
go out at different times, as the holes are at
different places. This is where your trick comes
in.</p>

<p>Place your candles in a row on a table,
with the holes away from your audience, and
then light all six. Now, you begin to relate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
a story about a little girl who was alone in
the house and was afraid of the dark, and who
lighted six candles to keep up her courage.
She heard queer noises about the house, and
drew close to the light, and then (pointing to
the candle with the hole nearest the top)
the first candle went out! Of course you time
your first words, so that you say “out” just
before the flame reaches the hole. As you
reach the second point in your tale the second
candle goes out, and so on throughout the rest
of the six. You may have the holes vary but
a fraction of an inch in their distances from the
top of the candle, and tell a very short story,
or you may have your tale a long one, with the
distances of the holes from the top of the candle,
varying an inch or so. By first lighting
one candle and watching it burn for a few minutes
you can tell almost exactly how long the
flame will take to reach a given point. If you
do not have the candles go out in rotation,
but skip around from the first to the fifth,
then to the second, to the sixth, the fourth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
third, you can still further mystify your audience,
and if your story be well told the effect
will be very pretty indeed.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Demon Bell.</b> A small bell is examined
and found to have no clapper. It is then presumed
it can make no sound, save by visible
means. However, the performer sets it upon
a small examined table, which stands quite close
to audience, and at command, the bell begins to
ring. It obeys every demand made upon it,
yet no means of producing sound can be found.</p>

<p>To produce this effect, use a small call-bell,
such as used on a table. A black thread is
carried across the stage, and one end is permanently
fastened, while the other is in the hands
of an assistant, who stands out of sight. In the
middle of thread is fastened a small shot.
The assistant uses this as a clapper, and when
examination is desired, he drops the thread and
shot on the floor, where they will not be visible.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Animated Skull.</b> This is a model in
papier-maché, and being hollow, is very serviceable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
It is caused to rise from the hat by
means of a black thread, which is carried
through a staple immediately over the performer’s
table, thence through another staple
out of sight and down to the assistant.</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Perilous Ring.</b> Put flour on a plate
in the shape of a high pyramid. On the very
tip of the pyramid place a ring. Arrange the
guests in line, and have each one in turn cut
away part of the flour with a knife, warning
them not to cut near enough to the ring to
make it fall, or the one doing so will suffer
a dreadful penalty. If the crowd is small each
will have several turns. The flour must be
cut away until the ring falls. It becomes very
exciting toward the end, as each one tries to
cut away as little as possible. When the ring
finally drops, the unlucky one must pick it
out of the plate with his teeth. Of course he
gets flour all over his nose and chin.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Nose and Goggle Party.</b> To fun-loving people
who enjoy the grotesque, great sport will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
be found in giving a Nose and Goggle Party.
Here two objects will be gained: merriment
and disguise.</p>

<p>Each guest wears a false nose and goggles.
The nose may be purchased, or clever fingers
can make it of heavy cardboard covered with
chamois.</p>


<p class="section"><b>Jack-o’-Lanterns.</b> The effect of these may
be heightened by sticking pins through pumpkin
seeds and placing them in the comers of
the eyes for the irises and into the mouth for
teeth. This makes the lantern exceptionally
attractive and “realistic.”</p>


<p class="section"><b>The Surprising Candle.</b> This is a very
clever contrivance, calculated to cause consternation
and astonishment to any individual with
ordinary nerves.</p>

<p>Supposing yourself to be the victim, how
would you feel if, when retiring to bed in some
strange establishment, just as you were thinking
of blowing out the candle, it should suddenly
explode with no small report, the light be extinguished,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and in place of the flame a small
ghost with outstretched arms would appear,
shining with a phosphorescent glow? I venture
to think you would be very, very much
surprised; and yet this is the effect produced by
this ingenious construction.</p>

<p>By examination it will be found that the
lower half of the candle is really a thin cardboard
case, enameled to resemble a wax candle,
and containing a small ghost whose arms fly
apart when released from their bondage. To
the bottom of this ghost is affixed a wire spring.</p>

<p>The upper half of the candle is perfectly
ordinary, and merely stuck on to the lower
portion; the joint being hidden by a rubbing
of wax.</p>

<p>On top of the ghost’s head a few gunpowder
caps, such as are supplied at toy shops for
children’s pistols, are laid.</p>

<p>Now the candle can be lighted, and it will
burn quite respectably until it reaches the caps,
which, by their explosion, cause everybody’s
attention to be drawn in that one direction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
just in time to see the appearance of the ghost,
it being forced upwards by the action of
the spring simultaneously with the discharge.
The wicked little image should be liberally
coated with luminous paint, and the effect can
be better imagined than described.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The foregoing are only a few of a vast number
of similar diversions, but they are ones
most to be commended, and will be sufficient
to produce many an hour of harmless mirth,
and very likely lead to the acquirement of
much useful knowledge, as well.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
